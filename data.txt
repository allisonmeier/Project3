~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred. 
King Edward is close
to finally realizing 
his father's ambition to create
a single kingdom... England. 
[Aelswith] You are as good and true
and faithful a man as your father.  
This is your destiny.  
To Bebbanburg then, Lord Uhtred?  
We retain Northumbria
for the Saxon people!  
  
[Uhtred] But the enemy has made
his own preparations for battle. 
When King Constantin's army appears
on the horizon, set fire to that church.   
Our plan to ambush is mistimed.
Constantin is already within the fortress.   
[Uhtred] Edward was anxious
to commence the attack... 
Our targets are all in one place.   
Storm the fortress now
and we trap Aethelhelm and Constantin.   
...but reluctantly agreed to hold back 
and allow me to attempt a rescue. 
He draws the guards down to the beaches
before the tide turns,   
giving you a very small
and reckless opportunity to get in   
by the guard's room before they return.   
[Uhtred] Whilst Aelswith
sought assistance from elsewhere. 
It is very foolish of you to come here.   
I'm no friend to Christians.   
[Uhtred] Edward's impatience
led him to renege on the plan 
and mount a rash assault
on the fortress. 
We have waited and heard nothing.   
The time offered to prevail
is slipping away.   
This is madness.   
[Aethelstan] Give us Lord Aethelhelm
and Lady Aelfwynn   
and we will not attack.   
Refuse and we will besiege
and kill you all!   
None will survive!   
[Uhtred] Destiny is all! 
   
   
   
I will assume that was a warning!   
   
They do not wish to comply.   
Did you see my father?   
   
I will get the girl,
parade her from the ramparts.   
Will King Constantin agree to that?   
If we do not ask, he cannot refuse.   
   
   
   
[Finan] Come on! Move! Move!   
Ignore all demands, play for time.   
Ignore a challenge, one king to another?   
It's dishonorable.   
Wait for your armies.   
Get the marriage bond sealed.   
I could, of course, simply hand you over.   
We are so close to getting what we want.   
You have confessed them.
Get to the sacrament.   
Are you ready?   
The gate guard can rebuff any assault,
but as a precaution,   
I would place
the Lady Aelfwynn somewhere safe.   
A higher room is fortified.   
Yes, wise. Aelfwynn, go with Lord Wihtgar.   
You see,   
we can withstand a siege.   
Just let Edward attack!   
To sit and wait,   
it's not in my blood.   
If he comes to the gate,   
I will speak to him.   
Why are we on the ramparts?   
To show Edward you are still alive.   
That is not what was discussed.   
Show her to the Saxons.   
Put a knife to her throat.   
Go! Offer a negotiation!
No!   
Say nothing.   
   
Truly King Edward does not come for me.   
I'm just caught in this.   
Then throw her over.   
Show them we are ruthless.   
   
Release her and I will not kill him.   
 Uhtred.   
   
Do you want to see him die?   
   
Let her go.   
Run.   
Run!   
   
   
   
 Follow him!   
   
 Guards, seize him!   
 Quick! Move yourselves!   
 Lord, here.   
   
You escaped?
Of course we did.   
And we found...    
Why did you come?    
I feared Haesten would betray your plan.    
He did not.    
He was put to the sword concealing it.    
Then his death finally brings him honor
and he will be welcomed to Valhalla.    
Did you find Aelfwynn?    
I had her within my grasp but no longer.    
And Edward has attacked, so time is short.    
Well, we still have the advantage.    
They do not know you are here.
[Wihtgar] Uhtred! Uhtred!    
Is that you or some other Uhtred?    
[Wihtgar] Uhtred!    
Where is he?    
[Aethelhelm] Who?
Edward's man is within! Uhtred!    
Uhtred of Bebbanburg.
Uhtred, the Imposter! Yes!    
This alliance has brought me nothing!    
Now he hunts me in my own fortress!    
If he hunts you, I suggest you find him.    
Send all armed guards to the gate!    
Bring my grandson Aelfweard to me.
I want the atheling by my side.    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
Quickly! Quickly, go to your positions!    
As fast as you can. We can hold them off.    
They are dogs. We are men!    
    
Quickly, carry on!    
Carry on!    
    
Go!    
    
    
    
    
    
We're saved!    
[Aethelhelm] Stand here with me.    
We have lost this fight.
Throw yourself at my father's mercy.    
I'll plead for you.    
You lost any influence with him
when you joined with me.    
We will hold our nerve and make you king.    
    
Your grandfather promises a great deal.    
Some more advice.    
When events change, plans should change.    
[Aethelhelm] Drink this.    
It'll calm your nerves.    
[Aelfweard] My father made me swear
I would not drink.    
 Well, your father has
not shown himself to be wise in judgement.    
[Aelfweard] We seem to be the ones...
Hild, if we distract the remaining guard,    
can you get her to the sea gate
and to safety with Father Pyrlig?    
Yes, I will need a torch to signal to him.    
You will need a weapon.    
    
I had hoped never to hold
such a thing again.    
It breaks my heart
to drag you to this fight.    
Nothing dragged me but my own will.    
Protect her as you have protected others.    
I will.    
Fight on for Bebbanburg.    
You've earned this, Uhtred.    
God is not cruel.    
Fight...    
as you need to fight.    
    
[Constantin] Well, your grandfather
may have friends anywhere...    
    
[Uhtred] We attack.    
It will draw in the guard to defend them,    
so the women can escape.    
Agreed?    
Mm.    
Your army, Lord King,
they are approaching!    
[Constantin] How far?
[Yahya] Two, three miles. Soon.    
See? We played for time.    
Hold your nerve. We will prevail!    
How long till the Saxons breach the gate?
Also soon.    
The gate will hold.
The armies will meet on the field.    
Edward will be routed by dusk!    
[Yahya] Do not tempt God
with so much pride.    
I am proud.    
Everything I predicted has come to pass.    
He heard of our rebellion,
came to our door.    
Rather than act with stealth,
he announced himself!    
I tell you, he is impulsive.    
Let him push, he will push too hard.    
Your army is behind him.    
If his pride is his fault,    
let him believe he has alarmed us.    
Open the sea gate.    
Let anyone without the stomach
for a fight leave.    
Take men off the gate
and reduce our defenses.    
A bold idea, Lord King,    
but given that we have provisions
for a siege, should we not...    
Sieges are for turds!    
Into the yard!    
They are pretending
to abandon Bebbanburg.    
Edward would not be that stupid.    
That will not work.    
Will it?    
 To the ramparts.    
Stay back!    
    
Leave us be!    
    
    
Did he strike?
    
    
    
[Hild] No!    
No, please don't...
    
    
    
Oh, Lord...     
Oh, forgive me.     
Thank you.
    
[Hild] There's more. Stay back!    
[Hild] Follow them. Father Pyrlig...    
    
    
    
    
    
It is foolhardy, Lord King.    
Let the soldiers do the fighting.    
I never saw you for a coward.    
[Wihtgar] Why have you commanded
to open the sea gate?    
    
Did you find your assassin?    
My men flee by the dozen!    
Good, fewer to protect here.    
Let Edward see us in retreat.
Bring down the men.    
You are sworn to him,
but he is sworn to me.    
Go.    
Pull back!    
Pull back. Stand down!    
Stand down!    
Do not believe it, Edward.    
    
Scots.    
Does the king see them?    
[Uhtred] No.    
Men are gathering behind the gates.    
They'll attack them on two fronts!    
    
We're beating them back.    
[Aldhelm] Lord King!    
Soldiers are rowing for their lives
from the sea gate,    
grabbing what tiny boats they can.    
They are leaving Bebbanburg in droves.    
What has happened within?
[Aldhelm] Unknown.    
There's been no word.    
Uhtred has taken command.
No!    
He could not take the fortress
with three men.    
We couldn't take it when we were a dozen.    
Nonetheless,
something has happened within.    
stab the horses
and I will lead the men out on foot!    
Let us finish this. Ready!    
With the king!    
Lord King,
the Scots may be closer than we know.    
It's the wrong ground for a battle...
It's why we strike before they come.    
Take the undefended fortress
and fight them from a secure position!    
God is with us, we can do this.
Lord, no!    
You are no warrior! Do not offer counsel!    
Leave the battlefield!    
I need soldiers who are with me.    
Do not come forward!    
Do not shoot!
    
    
    
Remain unseen. Stand by the gate.
Await my command.    
    
Let us view this victory from above,    
so we may preside over it.    
Men of Wessex!    
Men of Mercia!    
Now we take Northumbria for England!    
Advance!    
    
    
    
    
Lord King!    
    
[Aldhelm] Shield wall!    
    
[Edward] Pull back!
[Aethelstan] Get back!    
    
[Edward] Pull back!    
    
    
    
    
    
    
Shield wall!    
    
Father, they will push us into the sea!    
[Aldhelm] Hold the line! Push them back!    
You stupid arselings.    
Bastards!    
Arselings!    
    
Who is that? By the forest?    
[Sihtric] More Scots?    
    
Push!    
    
Hold them!    
    
[Cynlaef] Push back!    
Push back!    
[Constantin] Keep up the pressure!    
Push them over the cliff!    
    
    
    
    
Push on!    
    
    
    
    
    
Aldhelm!    
Aldhelm!    
    
    
    
[Uhtred] Stiorra! Stiorra, turn back!    
She says the battle is over, Uhtred.    
It is not.
Stiorra, please offer your support!    
I plead for my son, do not leave!    
Father, the battle cannot be won.
Edward has trapped himself.    
We cannot undo it.
Let me lead your men.    
Lady, do not weaken.
We cannot win this.    
I gathered all these men to help.
With all my heart I wanted to,    
but we're too late.
Come with us now. Save yourself.    
He will not leave the field.
Nor shall we.    
It is dangerous, yes.    
But we have to try.
The risk is too great!    
Your brother came here with us!    
Aethelstan is on the field.    
Aldhelm, Cynlaef,
many who are known to you!    
When I married Sigtryggr,
I chose his kin over my own.    
Sigtryggr would support me now.
You know this.    
He would not ask you to watch
your brother die and turn away.    
No Danes should die for Saxons,
not after all they have done to us.    
You have suffered at the hands
of Saxon kings, I know this.    
I promise, do this
and the Danes will be rewarded.    
You cannot promise me anything!    
She cannot. It is true.    
But I can.    
For I speak to you as a man
who has lived among you.    
Your gods are my gods.    
I was born a Saxon but raised a Dane.    
For years that divided me,    
but perhaps the Gods have led us all here!    
For I will offer you a bargain.    
I ask you to fight now
for me and for Northumbria.    
And if we take these lands,    
we will be taking them
for Saxons and for Danes.    
Follow me
and all Danes will live in peace here.    
I swear this to you!    
Danes will not be hunted,
nor live in forests!    
You will have lands and homes!    
And I ask you not to do this for Saxons.    
Do it for what your forebears
came here for.    
For the reason they risked their lives
and crossed the seas    
to make a homeland.    
Follow me and this I swear.    
You have my word...    
as a Saxon    
and as a Dane!    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
Sire, we're fighting on two sides!    
    
    
Charge!    
    
    
    
    
    
    
Charge!    
    
    
Odin favors us!    
    
Burn the fortress.    
I do not want their stronghold
on my border!    
Take any hostages you can!    
    
[Finan] Lord King! Help!    
[Wihtgar] Torch bearers! Stop them!    
    
    
We must get you to safety.    
If your father prevails,
I fear what he may do to you.    
    
    
    
[Uhtred] Did they get to safety?
Yes.    
How can I win you the day?    
They are taking hostages, do likewise!    
Take him, the commander. And find Finan!    
They're retreating!    
They're retreating.    
One more step and you will be killed.    
You should be pleading for your life.    
I know you're afraid to fight me.    
Of course, I'm afraid to fight you.    
We are not equals in sword-craft.    
    
So, if you agree to a fair fight...    
Ah, yes,    
you could never fight with honor.    
Honor does not win a fortress.    
    
    
    
    
Uhtred!    
Uhtred, do not fight alone!    
    
The stinking turd in his hole,    
unable to face the carnage
he has unleashed.    
Give me a reason not to cut the eyeballs
from your skull.    
[Aelfweard] kill him
and I'll have to fight you.    
Please, I beg for his life.    
Then you're a fool,    
for he has betrayed you
and Wessex many times.    
Ask him whose blood stains his hands!    
All I have done has been to protect him.
He knows this!    
If he knew all he would not stand by you!    
Tell him the worst of it.    
Tell him or I shall!    
Confess your sins and live,    
or die disgraced.    
Tell me, what does Aethelstan speak of?    
It is a story...    
which is hard to understand.    
It is not.    
It was for the honor of our bloodline...
Enough evasion, it sickens me!    
Aelfweard,    
it will scar your soul to hear this,    
but he had your mother killed
to start a war with the Danes.    
[Aethelhelm] That is not true!    
[Aethelstan] All know it.
And all are wrong!    
This has no truth? None at all?    
No, it does not. It is...    
There is a reason.    
She was not the target. It was a tragedy.    
She was killed by men you sent?    
And you told me that you feared
my father was to blame!    
For the blame is his!    
His disregard sent her to the pilgrims.    
I did not know!    
If I had known, never would I...    
Never!    
    
    
[Aelfweard] Do with him what you will.    
Aelfweard, no.    
I said you would live if you spoke true    
and you did.    
Now face the agony you caused.    
Tell my grandson I am a man of honor.    
    
Who is the Lord of Bebbanburg?    
 It belonged to my father!    
Who is the true heir?    
Say it!    
    
I will never surrender.    
    
kill me as I killed my father.    
That is the legacy of our line!    
Do this and your son will kill you.
    
That is the destiny!    
    
No, it's not.    
    
    
[Aethelstan] Uhtred!    
To the sea gate, Lord! Run!    
No, I will not leave and see it burn.
No!    
The smoke will choke you
before the flames even reach. Please!    
The gods will decide my fate.
If not for yourself then for me!    
Please, just move!
No!    
It is my destiny to die in Bebbanburg!    
    
    
    
    
    
King Constantin,    
welcome to Bebbanburg.    
I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred,    
heir to this fortress
and the lands that surround it.    
I acknowledge you as lord of this fortress    
and I recognize your authority
over the lands around it.    
Can we exchange?    
Is he still the man that was captured?    
[Uhtred] Of course, we're not savages.    
Return our men and you can have him.    
Six men for one, even for my nephew,    
it's not a fair price.    
I demand you swear to Scotland.    
No, that will not be.    
These are Saxon lands,
where Danes can thrive.    
These lands are disputed.    
And I will always claim them.    
But I'm ready to accept the offer.    
If you were wise, you'd strike a bargain
for a longer peace.    
Your men have been defeated.    
You have no power to bargain.    
I can bring more men.    
Lost battles do not mean lost wars.    
I'm not afraid to fight you.    
If you want to make a longer peace,
I will tell you my terms.    
Edward.    
The victory was ours.    
You could say that, Lord King.    
Hey! All stand for the king!    
My son, who has led us to such victory!    
Your heroism on the field of battle    
will live on in the songs
and in the chronicles.    
To you, we owe our life.    
Also to the Danes, Lord King.    
[Edward] Yes, also to the Danes.    
Who may live in these lands in peace.    
[Edward] Lord Uhtred of Northumbria,    
I congratulate you
on restoring your birthright.    
You honor your children
and bring them solace and healing.    
May these lands be held
by your descendants for all eternity.    
Let the sons of your sons profit
for generations!    
    
[Osbert] Why are we going to the fortress?    
[Hild] To meet the Lord of Bebbanburg.    
Why?    
Is this a trick
to make me learn scripture?    
 I know better than that, Osbert.    
No, I made a little inquiry    
and I think the new lord might be able
to tell you something of your origins.    
You think he may have once met my father?    
Yes. Something like that.    
Oh!    
You were worth the fight, my dearest girl.    
Your mother would be proud.    
I have a gift for you.    
How are the wounded?    
Some will take a while to recover.    
Perhaps you might... stay
and care for them here at Bebbanburg.    
Perhaps.    
I think that is an excellent idea.    
The sea air is very good
for all manners of illness.    
I shall of course need rooms
with a sea view.    
    
    
We will feast like brothers.    
For truly what you have done for my family
cannot be matched in many lifetimes.    
The debt is ours.    
We will feast and then I shall accept
your oath before the people.    
We will share the moment
England is finally made whole    
and defeat the Scottish claim forever.    
Constantin has withdrawn his claim
to these lands.    
Why would he do that?    
Because I offered
not to cede these lands to you.    
Instead we will remain between the two,
sworn to neither, to ensure peace.    
The people here are Saxon in their blood.    
Indeed, but they're not part
of your kingdom.    
We recognize you as our overlord
and we will pay you homage,    
but these lands will remain Northumbria's
and Northumbria's alone.    
They will not become part of England
in your lifetime.    
After everything we've given you,    
you choose now
to betray the House of Wessex?    
I betray nothing. The House of Wessex will
unite England eventually, I'm sure of it.    
I believe you are the true king
of the lands you hold,    
but the man who can unify this country
must be a figure    
behind which the people
can stand together as one.    
You have shown that you are not that man.    
You have sown discord
between Saxon and Dane.    
The future will come. Wait for it.    
Hey!    
To Bebbanburg!    
 To Bebbanburg!
    
 Uhtred! Uhtred!
Uhtred! Uhtred! Uhtred! Uhtred!    
Uhtred! Uhtred! Uhtred! Uhtred!
Uhtred! Uhtred! Uhtred! Uhtred...    
I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred. 
I was torn from my birthright 
and cursed to wander these lands
for many years. 
But now, as Lord of Northumbria, 
I am a thorn in the side
of the House of Wessex. 
I am all that stands between them
and a united England. 
Will Alfred's dream
be fulfilled in my lifetime? 
And if so, who will rule here? 
Will blood prevail? 
Or will king slay king once again
on the battlefield? 
I do not know what the gods choose. 
    
But now I am more certain 
they are on my side. 
And though my story has been woven
by hands that are not my own, 
the words I live by still stand true. 
I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred. 
For you and for myself... 
destiny is all!

I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred. 
Urgent news has reached Eoferwic. 
Aelfwynn was captured on the road.
By who?  
We believe them to be hired men.  
We suspect an association
with Lord Aethelhelm.  
[Uhtred] And my fate
has altered accordingly. 
Lord Aethelhelm is fomenting rebellion.  
He has made an alliance with Constantine  
and has offered him the hand
of Lady Aelfwynn.   
Where will we find him?   
In a fortress north of here,
name of Bebbanburg.   
[Uhtred] My birthright, stolen from me
by my cousin Wihtgar. 
Your name will be forgotten!   
   
[Uhtred] Now I have a chance
to take it back. 
I lead the men of Wessex and we push
the Scots back over the border.   
Meanwhile, Aethelhelm will be forced
to surrender and Aelfwynn returned.   
[Uhtred] But King Edward has
a different plan. 
In exchange for marrying Aelfwynn
and isolating Lord Aethelhelm,   
we will divide Northumbria in two.   
The lands around Bebbanburg
fall to the Scots   
and Aethelhelm is disposed of.   
[Uhtred] Yet he could find no support. 
[Aldhelm] I gave your sister my word
that I would keep Aelfwynn safe.   
I stand with Uhtred.
We stand with Uhtred.   
Aethelstan, my boy, what do you say?   
I will follow Lord Uhtred.   
Not sure things are going your way,
Lord King.   
   
[Edward] I will brook no more defiance.   
No one will leave on penalty of execution!   
[Uhtred] Destiny is all! 
   
Come on! Quicken the pace!
Sunrise comes swiftly.   
Hey, perhaps don't kill me
just before departure.   
Move!   
Any word if the king will relent?
He has shunned all his advisers.   
[Finan] He wouldn't turn swords
on Saxons, surely.   
Tell that to the Mercian Ealdormen.   
We leave at sunrise.   
Do his men still bar the gate?   
Yes, and the Mercians
seem set on departure.   
I fear neither will back down.   
Another person who cannot sleep?   
   
I am not in the king's favor tonight.   
I told him he should not turn his back
on Northumbria and he was not pleased.   
No man enjoys hearing the truth
from the woman he loves.   
Hm.   
All the same, when it must be delivered,
God is with us.   
[Edward] My orders are still defied.   
Prepare the men of Wessex.
All must gather at the gate.   
Yes, Lord King.   
Lady.   
Edward, do not turn on other Saxons.   
Eadgifu, you should be returning
to Winchester.   
Now is not the time to become allies.   
We are not allies,
merely the women who love you.   
I swear, I will say the truth as I see it
and then leave.   
Your plan, to forsake Aelfwynn   
and make a bargain with the Scots
is not without merit.   
It could bring peace, yes,   
but at the cost of dividing the Saxons.   
Do not risk sundering Mercia from Wessex.   
You should be advising Lord Aldhelm.   
But I shall not,
for I agree with Lord Aldhelm.   
Aethelflaed would follow Uhtred.   
I am the king. I do not follow.   
You are a king
who is choosing not to lead.   
A choice so strange, I ask myself why.   
And I only have one conclusion.   
Fear.   
I do not fear Aethelhelm, Constantin or...
No, but you fear Alfred and his legacy.   
So I will tell you one thing.   
You are strong enough to be the man
to fulfill your father's dream.   
You do not have to leave it
to your descendants.   
You are worthy to live in the chronicles,   
as the one who unified England.   
It is not fear that holds me back.
I am your mother   
and I know when you are afraid.   
So I am here to tell you   
that I believe you are deserving
of this moment.   
You are as good and true   
and faithful a man as your father.   
And for that, God will favor you.   
This is your destiny.   
Seize this moment.   
 Leave your posts!
Rejoin the army!   
Wessex have stood down.   
[Finan] Edward's men
no longer defend these walls.   
We ride.   
Open the gates.
 Lord. Yes, Lord.   
To Bebbanburg then, Lord Uhtred?   
Let the king have his moment.   
If that is your command.   
I will need someone loyal to hold
the border lands in Northumbria.   
We confront the Scottish king on the road!   
We break his alliance with Lord Aethelhelm   
and make a bargain
for Aethelflaed's daughter.    
We retain Northumbria
for the Saxon people!    
    
To Bebbanburg!
    
    
    
    
    
Are we expecting to be besieged?    
No, we are expecting to decamp
and go south for battle.    
We shan't avail ourselves of Northumbrian
hospitality any longer than is necessary.    
As soon as Constantin's army arrives    
and the marriage is consummated,    
we will be on our way with our supplies.    
When do they arrive, this army?    
Soon.    
[Wihtgar] He does not know.    
For all this bluster, he does not know
when these Scotsmen will come.    
He just hopes they do.    
Does your cousin Uhtred still fight
for the King of the Saxons?    
Yes.    
Which is why
we will not be leaving these walls    
whatever promises we have made,
whatever alliance.    
[Sihtric] Look who I found
on the road ahead.    
Cynlaef. You're late.    
Lord, I've had a momentous journey,
so much to tell.    
First I found myself lost    
by the broken bridge in...
No! No, not the time, Cynlaef.    
What news do you bring?    
Just what was seen
by scouts two nights ago.    
Constantin's men preparing a boat
near his port at Dynbaer.    
One boat will not transport an army.    
It could be an advance guard,
sailing with Constantin himself?    
Constantin is a great king.    
He would not arrive into a fortress
by the sea gate like a trader.    
He could be bringing a gift
for the wedding feast?    
No, this endeavor is a show of strength.    
He will lead as many men on the road
as he can gather.    
I agree. It is unlikely
he will arrive south by sea.    
Constantin is strategic. He will know
how changeable the tides are,    
the risk of summer storms.    
All right, we stay with the plan.    
With luck,
his full army will take days to gather.    
Onward.    
[Yahya] Each man is to report back
three times daily.    
When King Constantin's army appears
on the horizon, set fire to that church.    
Mother.    
    
This is where you will stay.    
Imagine that is a line you do not cross.    
Oh, Edward, my life is unimportant.    
Your bloodline is safe...
and that is all that matters.    
How far is Bebbanburg?    
Five miles, but our journey is longer.    
At dawn we head west through the woods,
go around the fortress at a distance.    
Make our ambush on the roads above it.    
I am not one to ask military questions,    
but surely word will spread
of a mighty army camping nearby?    
There comes a point
at which we cannot hide.    
We just have to pray that God is with us.    
You will stay here and not foolishly
go out onto the battlefield?    
If the injured need my help I may...
She will not.    
We know our role in this.    
Some moments men must face alone,
and this is one.    
    
Alert our lord.    
[Yahya] It is the king.    
A king would choose a finer ship.    
Except for perhaps this one.    
My men disembark at the sea gate.    
A king arrives at a fortress
through the front.    
    
 Here they come.    
    
[Yahya] Stand alert
for the King of the Scots!    
Lord King. You are a little in advance
of what we had planned.    
I like to catch people off guard.
    
I was hoping your arrival
would be a little more clandestine.    
I did not become a king
to hide in a forest.    
[Aethelhelm] Yet we have on our side
the most precious asset    
one can gain in war,
the element of surprise.    
Squander that
and we risk Edward learning of...    
 There are spies everywhere.
He will hear soon enough.    
Indeed, but his weakness
is his impulsiveness.    
When he learns of our alliance he will...
I will not sit and wait for an attack.    
It is cowardly.    
I thought we had agreed
an attack would be launched    
once you had cemented ties with Mercia.    
And I am a man of my word.    
    
Is that the boy who'd be
King of the Saxons?    
Indeed. Aelfweard,
come and bow to King Constantin...    
A word of advice from a king
to a future king.    
Trust no one who advises you.    
    
Understood.
 Well, let's eat.    
    
Ask Lady Aelfwynn to join us.    
No!    
I should prefer to meet her alone,
after we've dined.    
Never meet a bride on an empty stomach.
    
Eh?     
    
    
Hey, what do you say, Lord?    
Lose the deadwood, jump on some horses,    
ride up to the gate, just the three of us,
teach your cousin a lesson?    
Riding up to the gate
is something I've tried before.    
Perhaps better your way than to drag
all of these people to their doom.    
[Finan] Ah, come on!
They want to join you.    
This is what they've been waiting for.    
They'll tell stories
of this their whole lives.    
"Bebbanburg, my part in its conquest."    
[Sihtric] Hey.    
Lord, the news is heavy.
Our plan to ambush is mistimed.    
Constantin is already within the fortress.    
The spies say he came by sea.    
I am at fault. I counseled this.
[Uhtred] You're not.    
Much of this is judgment
and we misjudged it.    
How many men were in this boat?    
We think only a household guard.    
As Uhtred predicted.    
Do not assume it is a sign.
We simply make another plan.    
It is a sign we should attack.
Before his army arrives...    
No.
Our targets are all in one place.    
Storm the fortress now
and we trap Aethelhelm and Constantin.    
Aelfwynn is within. She will be forced to
this marriage and they will threat her.    
Yes, they'll try to use her
in a bargain, but...    
But we trust Aethelhelm
to act with reason when he's in a corner?    
If we'd got to Constantin,
then it would be a negotiation,    
but now we give him nothing to lose.    
We have hundreds of men.
Bebbanburg is well defended, yes,    
but we will surely outman them.    
His own daughter died amidst the fury
of his scheming.    
We cannot risk Aethelflaed's child
in the chaos that will engulf Bebbanburg.    
[Uhtred] There is another way.    
    
I will leave with some of my men.
Wait until you have word from us.    
We shall get Aelfwynn out of the fortress,
then you can attack.    
How?
The sea gate, Lord?    
No. There is a route to Bebbanburg which...    
 it cannot take an army,
not even half a dozen men.    
I had dismissed it as too perilous,
but... with a tiny number,    
maybe it is possible.    
What happens when this tiny number
meets the Household Guard of Bebbanburg?    
Pyrlig, are you strong enough to join us?    
Are you strong enough to stop me?    
Lord, let me be a part of this.    
Whatever the danger,
I'm man enough to face it.    
Four is a number
that's always served us well in the past.    
Stand the men down.
Do not attack until I signal.    
Enough evasion. What is the plan?    
If it works, we will return with Aelfwynn.    
If it does not?    
Then this will be the last time
we speak together.    
We go north, past Bebbanburg,
on to the next cove.    
We will seek the help of someone I know.    
What if help is not forthcoming?    
Then Finan will have to think
of something.    
What?    
    
We have work to do.
No flirting with the nuns.    
We'll leave that to you, Uhtred.    
    
If you had written,
we would have brewed some ale.    
[Uhtred] You are here!
 You are lucky.    
I've been on the island most of the month.
You should have sent word.    
I did not know I was coming.    
But the Gods had other plans.
Have you come for Aalys?    
She's in much better spirits,    
though she does still dream
of the queen's death.    
I come for Bebbanburg.    
Is it the time? Have you the men?    
Edward has an army south of here.    
Huh. Normally we hear of such things.    
First, I must get into the fortress    
with a small number of men
to secure the Lady Aelfwynn.    
Ah. Have you a plan?    
One is forming, yes, but I will need help.    
Not yours, I will need the help of...
No! No, he's too young.    
Not his help. No, not his at all.    
Is by any piece of luck
the trader Haesten still in these lands?    
    
Uhtred, truly the Gods are with you. Come.    
He refuses to leave
because he's making such good coin here.    
We've become quite the marketplace.
I will find you.    
Steal from me and you'll regret it!    
    
    
Uhtred!
I've come to offer silver not to take it.    
I'm not in need
and I have already done your bidding.    
Yes, I know, and now I want more.
    
I am to enter Bebbanburg    
and you are to help me
by distracting the Household Guard.    
No.  No, absolutely not.
Not today, not any day.    
It is an unwise choice.    
I will retake my lands    
and then we will return
to punish you for this refusal.    
    
threat me and I shall go to Bebbanburg
tonight and warn them of your attack.    
No, you will not.    
I'm busy making silver.    
Tell me.    
Will Valhalla welcome a man
who sells relics to fools?    
My ancestors came to these lands
to become rich, Uhtred.    
I'm merely living my birthright.    
You will not even need
to wield your sword.    
All I ask is that you draw the guard
to the shore.    
And for that, I will pay you... handsomely.    
    
You do not have the coin.    
And yet you know that I will
when I retake Bebbanburg.    
And in the contest between Wihtgar and me,
you know who will win.    
    
I'm not known for my loyalty, Uhtred.    
It is not wise to put this in my hands.    
    
It is not simple
to lure a guard away from their defenses.    
It will cost you.
Yes, I know.    
Finan is outside.    
He will explain the plan.    
Pyrlig can borrow our smallest boat.    
If they spot him on the water they should
just assume he's part of the pilgrimage.    
Make sure you return it.    
I will do all I can.    
Good luck.    
    
I wonder... perhaps I should join you.    
No, please do not.
You have things to protect here.    
I'm never certain Haesten can be trusted.    
Am I making the right choice?    
It cannot be wrong
to protect the Lady Aelfwynn    
or to seek a home for your children.    
Whether this is the time
that has been chosen for you,    
that I cannot say. I hope it is.    
But your motive is pure
and so my God will be with you.    
Get it done as dawn rises.    
And tomorrow will be the first day
of a new world.    
Does everyone understand the plan?
Yes!    
Yes.
Hey, do it for him.    
He draws the guards down
to the beaches before the tide turns,    
giving you a very small
and frankly slightly reckless opportunity    
to get in by the guards' room
before they return.    
You're forgetting the bit
where you sit on your ass.    
Yeah, I... I sit on my ass in the boat.    
Hm.
Get them out when the signal comes.    
Excellent, we're all agreed.    
Night approaches
and there is still no word from Uhtred.    
Lord King, be patient.    
He has never let you down.    
Never before
was he fighting for his own lands.    
 As much as he speaks of Saxon
unity, we know what brings him here.    
I do not think that is fair.
Perhaps not.    
But who has the best interests
of the Saxon people at heart,    
Uhtred or me? I will not...
Lord...    
Spies north of here say the Scots have
left a camp and march in this direction.    
How long until they reach Bebbanburg?
[Cynlaef] Unclear.    
It will depend on whether they stop
to meet reinforcements    
or if that is the full force.
And what of Uhtred?    
 No word, no sighting.    
We cannot track him.    
What is being discussed
that we should know?    
What is being kept from me?    
I fear he is going to attack.    
Without Lord Uhtred?    
He does not seem to care
if my father lives or dies.    
Talking to him of Aelfwynn has no effect
and he has no thought for Lord Aelfweard.    
Edward is lost.    
To be so enraged
by Aethelhelm's treachery,    
he would risk his own son in a siege?    
Something has gripped him.    
It is as if he now believes
he has divine blessing.    
    
My lady.    
Lady.    
I may have been too emphatic
in my encouragement of the king.    
Come, ride with me south.    
No! I will not flee the battle.    
I will stay where I may be of use
to injured men.    
I am not suggesting we flee,    
but if you want to avert a slaughter,
then follow.    
    
    
[Constantin] Do you plan to jump
and swim away?    
Perhaps.    
Well, do not be fooled by the calm.    
The tides here change quickly.
You'd be dashed on the rock.    
I do not care. My life is over.    
Are you the King of the Scots?    
Are you the bride?    
So I'm told.    
Why are you not married?
You're older than my father.    
Which father would that be?    
    
My apologies, it's an unkind joke.    
You already hate me?
Yes.    
Why?    
Because I do not wish to marry you!    
It is a simple truth.
This is being forced upon me.    
I do not wish to marry you either.    
Then free me from this bargain.
No.    
Because I have given my word.    
I am being traded.    
    
That's just the way of things.
    
You will be rich and well-cared for.    
It is not a terrible curse...
You have no idea! None!    
Who is it that you're fond of?    
I'm sorry?    
Who has your heart
that fosters so much resentment?    
Lord King, I'm pure.    
I'm not asking that.    
I will not share the content of my heart.    
Well, um...    
as we... we will be married,    
I feel I should offer you my trust.    
I am in love.    
The woman is married herself...     
Yet she is mine.    
And I have no wish to betray her
by humping a girl of noble blood.    
So...    
you will be my wife.    
You will live in comfort
in whichever fortress best pleases you.    
I shall enjoy the riches of your lands
in Mercia.    
I may visit...    
but not your chamber.    
In short,    
the marriage will be barren    
and I will never love you.    
Lord King...    
that is the first time someone
has been honest with me for quite a while.    
    
    
    
[Finan] Thin fellas were they,
your forebears?    
    
[Sihtric] How long will we have
to get in and out?    
[Uhtred] Haesten makes landfall
and all goes to plan,    
long enough.    
My lord.    
The seas have betrayed another ship.    
    
    
This shore is the land
of Wihtgar of Bebbanburg.    
You know this.    
We do not seek to trespass,    
only to wait for our cargo and salvage it.    
Who travels with you, Nun?    
A trader bringing relics to Lindisfarne.    
Name yourself.    
Haesten. Allow us to wait for the tide    
and you can have some spoils.    
    
Wait here.    
[Uhtred] The path has gone.    
[Finan] Is there another way?
Can we go back on ourselves?    
There's no time. The tide is turning.
Men will be leaving their posts.    
    
    
You always wanted to die at Bebbanburg.    
[Uhtred] Less talk. We climb.    
Offer no help. Now is not the time
to be distracted by acts of local charity.    
Lord King,
we have extended much hospitality    
to you and Lord Aethelhelm.    
Allow me to claim the spoils
as recompense.    
What's the cargo?    
Salt and relics.    
When the tide comes in, more may follow.    
On my land, I take what washes in.    
That is indeed the custom.
You may do as you see fit.    
But...    
I'd be wary of a ploy.    
Danes send men to observe
in the weeks before they attack.    
Once we have departed south,    
you may be at the mercy of sea raiders.    
Then you'll seek to welcome us.    
You men, to the shore.    
You men, to the courtyard.    
You may take your fill as the tide turns.    
[Haesten] Is that the cousin?
Yes. There's not such a resemblance.    
I know a greedy man when I see one.    
You should have much in common.
You should be able to keep him talking.    
[Haesten] Thank you for allowing us
to gather our treasure.    
We will see what else washes up
and leave your land.    
Not at all, consider yourself my guests.    
Come into the fortress where we have fire.    
That is a kindness,
but we have much to do.    
I have pilgrims
I need to ferry to the island.    
Too many dangers present themselves
to travelers here.    
Come into the fortress.    
A wedding feast is imminent
and that is a delight we wish to share.    
My men will gather your cargo,
though, of course we will take a tribute.    
    
[Wihtgar] Take your fill
of the riches, men!    
Haesten is feeling generous.    
    
Oh, Jesus!    
Can you believe that?    
    
    
Give me your hand! Give me your hand!    
Give me your other hand!    
Pull! Pull up!    
    
    
Thank you.    
    
Quickly grab what you can
and return to your posts.    
And keep an eye out for more Danish ships!    
I'd like somewhere quiet to dress.    
Are there ladies' quarters
in the fortress?    
You may find your way down to the kitchen.
There are some women there.    
    
This one.    
[Uhtred] This repair looks weakest.
Try it.    
    
Too fast and too loud!    
I cannot hear anyone.    
I think Haesten has got them to the shore.    
[Aethelhelm] Haesten!    
Now that is a face I would not forget.    
Are you the poor soul
that was shipwrecked?    
Yes.
Ah.    
I do not recall you, Lord.    
No.    
No, it seems you do not.    
    
The last time we met,    
you imprisoned me in Alfred's tomb.    
Siege at Winchester,
it is imprinted on my memory.    
And yet you lived and thrived afterwards.    
We were both...    
younger men.    
My grandson barely slept
for years afterwards.    
Well, I have removed the icicles
from my balls    
and will be on my way.    
    
Stay a while, Haesten.    
We have such memories to share.    
    
    
    
    
    
Block the hole.    
That's enough.    
[Sihtric] Lord.    
[Finan] Hey, hey.    
Here, you are most likely
to be recognized.    
What if one of you two gets spotted?    
I've a plan for that.    
Come on. Let's find Aelfwynn!    
    
Lord King, wait for Uhtred's signal.
We have waited and heard nothing.    
The time offered to prevail
is slipping away.    
But what of Uhtred or Aelfwynn?
They will be killed!    
This is madness.
Yes.    
But we must follow.    
    
Is that the King of the Scots?    
Aye.    
Lord!    
Lord!    
Lord!    
    
You men!    
Stay in the courtyard.    
Why does Constantin place his men here?    
 We do not discuss
what measures we take.    
Aye!    
    
King Constantin?    
Your man strays where he is not wanted.    
He's no man of mine.    
    
I think you've been fooled, Lord Wihtgar.    
How did you get past my men?    
Are you shipwrecked Danes also?    
[Wihtgar] torture them for answers.    
Show them what any sea raider would face.    
    
You do God's work, my friends.    
You shall make twice this
on my next cargo.    
    
    
Lady Aelfwynn?
Yes?    
Come.
No!    
Come! I'm trying to rescue you!    
I have heard that many times before
and it's never been true.    
Lady Aelfwynn, I am Lord Haesten.    
I was a friend of your true father!
Lord Haesten?    
Tried to kill my mother! Help!    
Help me! Lord King!    
This man is trying to seize me.    
The girl is mistaken.    
If I offended the young lady, I apologize.    
Our ways with women
are not the same as yours.    
    
I'm a man of honor.
Perhaps I am misunderstood.    
You're a liar.    
Your plot is discovered
and your other men captured.    
Tell me the truth
of why you came to Bebbanburg    
and I shall take only their lives.    
    
I will tell you the truth,    
for I serve no one but myself.    
I have no allies here    
and I'm part of no plan.    
    
    
Have rid of this.    
And fetch the priest!    
Get this marriage over!    
Perhaps we have gone the wrong way.    
The farmer said this was east,
but now I think it is west.    
I was told many have joined her,
here amongst the trees.    
We know you are here!    
We have seen your scouts!    
[Stiorra] Lady Aelswith.    
[Finan] Do your worst!
You'll get nothing out of us.    
    
It is very foolish of you to come here.    
I'm no friend to Christians.    
Perhaps, yes.    
But...    
we need your help.    
    
Halt!    
Let me strike the first blow.
    
[Yahya] My lord!    
Soldiers approach from the south.    
How many?
Many.    
I shall return. Wait.    
    
    
    
 You, secure the gate! Secure it!    
[Uhtred] Oh no, no, not yet.    
    
    
Come no closer!    
Speak!    
I bring a message from Edward,    
King of the Saxons
and king in these lands!    
Give us Lord Aethelhelm and Lady Aelfwynn
and we will not attack.    
Refuse and we will besiege
and kill you all!    
None will survive!

SEASON: 05
EPISODE: 08
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[Uhtred] I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred. 
Edward marched his forces to Eoferwic,
where he received momentous news. 
We have been both blessed and cursed.  
There can be no more bastards.  
We are to be wed.  
 Let us fetch a priest.  
So soon, Father?  
So I am to be replaced also.  
[Uhtred] Aelfweard left the city
with reluctant company... 
Journey to where?   
To join my grandfather.   
...for Aethelhelm had traveled north 
and made an alliance
with King Constantin of Scotland. 
You help me raise rebellion
against the king,   
we put my grandson
on the throne in Wessex,   
we would offer half the profits
from the lands of Mercia   
through a marriage bond
to the Lady Aelfwynn.   
[Uhtred] Lady Aelswith failed
in her attempt to free Aelfwynn... 
...from Aethelhelm's men. 
   
Do not fight it!   
   
   
 Aelfwynn! Run!
   
[Uhtred] Following Sigtryggr's death, 
Stiorra sought revenge
against those who brought her sorrow. 
[Stiorra] Please tell me
Brida is your captive.   
I cannot.   
Then tell me she will be mine
so that I may punish her.   
Knowing our fates are entwined,
I answered Brida's call. 
   
We both knew this was a fight to
the death, but our bonds were too deep. 
I will not kill you.   
If there was hope before,
there can be hope again.   
   
[Uhtred] What have you done?!
Ragnar...   
[Uhtred] Destiny is all. 
   
   
   
   
 What are you doing here? 
   
   
I will see you in Valhalla.   
   
[Uhtred] Stiorra.   
[Uhtred] Stiorra!   
Stiorra! Why will you not speak with me?   
I have freed you from her curse,
there is nothing more for us to say.   
She did not curse me.
She was coming back to me.   
She could have been saved.   
Sigtryggr did not have
the chance to be saved.   
I will never understand
why you were granting it to her.   
You could have stopped her,
but you never did.   
You let this happen, many times.   
It is done. It is over now.   
Stiorra, please come with me.   
We can go home.   
You have no home.   
You have nothing to offer me.   
Stiorra, you have suffered too much.   
No! Those who have hurt me
have suffered too little.   
No one has felt pain like I have endured.
Not yet.   
Your life is not over.   
Yes, you have lost,
but you will find new purpose.   
We carry our losses,
but we journey onward.   
I will journey onward, yes,
but not with you.   
We will build here.   
There is wood and fresh water and loyalty.   
Other Danes are coming.   
We will live as Danes and die as Danes.
You will not find peace here.   
Then I will find it
in Sigtryggr's dead embrace.   
No, do not say that.
That path is not meant for you.   
That is not what the gods want.   
I no longer believe in destiny.   
   
You have always spoken as though
every action is part of some plan.   
Everything you have done has been excused
because it was not your choice.   
That is not true.
I have not walked blindly.   
All your battles,
all those you have killed.   
You chose them over your family
and called it fate.   
What your destiny has brought me
is pain and grief.   
So now my choice
is to turn my back on you.   
[Stiorra] Yah!
   
   
   
   
Lord Aethelhelm...   
You have visitors.   
The Lady Aelfwynn is here?
No.   
Then kindly tell them I will attend
when I am ready.   
I am not your lackey.   
You may be an ally of King Constantin,
but you are a guest in my fortress...   
I am ready.   
Who is here for me?   
Your grandson.
Aelfweard?   
Why did you not say?   
    
[Aethelhelm] Now, this, this is a mercy!    
Oh, beloved child of my child!    
At last we're reunited.    
Oh, no.
    
Oh, now, whatever is the matter?    
You've been told of my mother's death?    
Of course.    
And though my heart is broken...    
having you here is some reprieve
from the unending sadness.    
My father has already remarried.    
The new queen is with child.    
Ah.    
It will likely be a boy,
your father's seed is strong,    
and should he view you
as a threat to the succession,    
then your life will be in danger.    
My worst fears come to pass.    
I... I do not think he would harm me.    
The king can be most... unforgiving.    
Indeed, in my darkest hours,    
I imagine your mother's death
was on his command.    
[Aelfweard] No, it was the Danes.    
He may not have loved her as we did,
but... but that he would not do.    
Of course. I am sure you are right.    
But everything we do hence
is to honor her hopes for you.    
Are we united?    
Always. With a whole heart.    
And Father Benedict.    
Welcome to Bebbanburg!    
My everlasting thanks
for bringing the boy.    
All debt to me is paid.    
    
Twice over.    
[Aethelhelm] Now come,
tonight we celebrate your arrival.    
[Aethelhelm] Drink well, feast well, all.    
Great energy will be required
for the times ahead.    
Eat!    
How are we to proceed?    
Well, first...    
    
    
A wedding.    
King Constantin of Scotland travels here
to be married...    
to Lady Aelfwynn.    
[Aelfweard] My cousin is here?
May I see her?    
She has not yet arrived,
despite your grandfather's promises...    
She will be here.
She's simply taking her time.    
Like all women, she rides slowly.
    
She wishes to marry this King Constantin?
I would not want her to be forced.    
She will understand
that it is for the best, my boy.    
It seals your alliance
with the Scottish king    
and gives him reason
to support our rebellion.    
It will provoke your father to war.    
A war? I thought you said
we could do this without bloodshed...    
Not war.    
Confrontation, which we will win.    
Some blood may be spilled,
some villages burned, but...    
We will present the king
with our superior strength    
and he will concede defeat.    
And in return for that concession,
you will be declared the next king.    
Then it will be an end.    
Or your father will be killed.    
Grandfather, reassure me
to kill my father is not part of the plan.    
I am a man of peace.    
All I do is for the good of the Saxons.    
Edward, he's grown tyrannical.    
Tell that to the Danes of Rumcofa
killed on your order.    
Each one complicit
in the murder of my daughter!    
Do not doubt me on this, Benedict.    
I have proved many times
that I am righteous in word and deed.    
Then I would hate for you
to meet that which you dread.    
I should like to pray, alone.    
I have verses I must study.    
Perhaps there are    
some wise words
in the book about the sort of man I am.    
Perhaps you do not know me as you think.    
    
[Aldhelm] Lord King,
word has returned from the south.    
Aelfweard is not in Winchester,
nor anywhere in Wessex.    
Do you think he went to Aethelhelm?    
It would seem likely.    
Though we know not where.    
The ingratitude.    
The dishonor of it.
How could the boy be so foolish?    
He is still in grief for his mother
and our marriage was quite hasty.    
Do not attempt to dilute my anger.
He is a boy. As my child will be a boy.    
No mother wants
to see a man reject his son.    
As ever, you speak with reason.    
I am wounded by his betrayal.    
As you should be.
It is a grievous offense.    
I thought I had more mastery of things,
but now I find myself reacting yet again    
to Aethelhelm's provocation,
unable to gain the momentum.    
Dragging myself on horseback to chase him.    
The momentum brought you Eoferwic.    
And your boldness against Sigtryggr
won you a kingdom that eluded your father.    
At whose arrangements? Aethelhelm's.    
That is a cruel irony, yes, but it...
I fear it is more than that.    
 What does this mean?    
All of it, why... why does it occur?    
In unreasonable haste,
I win Mercia and Eoferwic.    
Two conquests that evaded kings
greater than I...    
You deserve your success.
Do I?    
Perhaps God tests me.    
Or perhaps the devil tempts me
to overplay my hand.    
This humiliation...    
this betrayal by my son...    
    
...it is a moment that challenges my pride
and I must think clearly.    
[Edward]    
Aelfweard is lost to me.    
Were we to find him,
this I would struggle to forgive.    
To flee the palace and ally with a man    
who has done so much wrong
to me and to Wessex,    
I do not think I can forgive it.    
We have another son in your belly.    
Perhaps I should accept
Aelfweard is forfeit    
and allow him to range
like a fugitive with Aethelhelm.    
That will mean he is always a threat.    
Better a threat away from Winchester
than within the palace.    
Well, it would take great strength
to ignore such an offense.    
I know and I struggle with it,
but my heart tells me    
to not once again take the bait
Aethelhelm has cast upon the waters.    
I ignore provocation,
fortify enough to rebuff them,    
but do not chase them down
and walk into a trap.    
Am I foolish? Is that the devil's course?    
    
Well, I...    
I would never try to guess
the mind of the devil.    
Just as I would never suggest
you forfeit your son for my child.    
But as one who counsels you, I would say    
it is a wise strategy
to settle for these gains.    
You control three of the four kingdoms.    
In time, our son can fight for the last.    
There is no dishonor in this path
if you choose it with a clean heart.    
If I do not play, Aethelhelm cannot win.
Mm.    
He then dances to my song.    
And I prevail.    
After the fight is over...    
when we agree a truce,    
we build a new palace...    
in Lundene.    
It stands between Mercia and Wessex.
It's well placed for trade.    
It should be at the heart
of your new kingdom.    
This is all very ambitious, Grandfather.    
I only hope I'm worthy
of your faith in me.    
It is not mere faith! It is your blood!    
With the right advice...    
your people will sing of you
as Aelfweard the Great!    
Your reign will hold in the same esteem
as Charlemagne!    
And we will raise a minster
to your dear mother.    
Under your rule, never again
will a heathen harm any of our people.    
Never will a boy lose his mother
as you did.    
Is he drunk?
He has not been on the ale.    
I think perhaps he really believes
he can unseat the Saxon king.    
    
Maybe it's time to kiss his arse?    
I am a man of low principles.    
I prefer to call you pragmatic, Lord.
Mm.    
Yet even I would not stoop
to seek the favor of that...    
 ...Wessex turd.    
I am not certain that our host
welcomes your ambition.    
Then he will learn what happens
when you cross men like us.    
[Rognvaldr] You! Boy!    
Fetch me ale! Fetch ale for your king.
 Ye... Yes, Lord.    
Watch his back hoof, he's tired.    
I have abused his good nature.    
[Pyrlig] Uhtred.    
[Pyrlig] She failed to kill me.    
[Uhtred] What a joy
to see you well, Pyrlig.    
Did you find her?
Yes, I found her.    
Where is she now?    
She's with the gods.    
You decided to kill her?
No.    
You were right. But, uh...    
I will tell you all.    
For now I want you to go to your sister.
She has secluded herself in the forest.    
I want you to find her, speak with her
and make her come to Rumcofa.    
Why has she gone to the forest?    
She believes there's no place for her,
but she's wrong.    
She has suffered much, Uhtred.    
Perhaps it is wiser to let her be
rather than to command her.    
No, I shall not abandon her again.    
I will prove there is a place
for her in Rumcofa.    
And that I can be a true father.    
Father, the sentiment is truly noble,
but Stiorra has been a queen.    
She cannot live
in Rumcofa as a trader's wife.    
Besides, too much has happened there
for it to be a place of sanctuary.    
Nevertheless, it is all we have.    
Lord!    
[Finan] Ah. You're alive.    
[Uhtred] I am.    
[Aethelstan] And Brida?    
 No.    
[Finan] I know you did what you could.
At least it's over now, hmm?    
[Aethelstan] We know you will have chosen
the right path, Uhtred.    
You should take some time, rest yourself.    
[Uhtred] Indeed.    
I was thinking it is time we go back
to the peace of Rumcofa.    
I promised I'd return you
to your families.    
The danger's over now.
We can stop running for Wessex,    
make some coin from the toll
on the trade river.    
Fight the raiders,
go back to how things were.    
Lord, no.    
Our families have fled to Wessex, Lord.    
They have settled.
They are waiting for us.    
Our lives in Rumcofa are destroyed.
Let the dead rest in peace, hey?    
But it can be a home,
a real home for us, for our families.    
Aethelstan, you loved it there.
I did.    
 I do wish to be alongside you...
And I want you there.    
I also wish to serve my father.
He needs loyalty. And I... I need...    
I understand.
You will come visit us, I'm sure.    
Lord...    
Uhtred, we are brothers for life,
thick and thin.    
We'll ride with you to death.
You know that.    
But this is not the right choice, Lord.
Our time in Rumcofa has passed.    
There... There are too many things there
to remind us of what we have lost.    
But we cannot roam forever.    
We cannot leave our children
without a place to find comfort.    
Uhtred, come on!    
I've lost Stiorra
until I can offer her hope.    
I need you to agree.    
If you command Rumcofa, we'll follow you.
But I ask, is there another path?    
 Open the front gate!    
A lesson for you, act with confidence,
providence smiles.    
[Aethelhelm] Lady Aelfwynn.    
Will you come down from your horse?    
Do I have any choice in the matter?
Do not be afraid.    
I do not intend violence,
merely to bring peace.    
Where's Bresal?    
[Glaedwine] There was a fight.
He did not survive. I'm sorry, Lord.    
I know he was a good friend to you.    
The men I truly count as friends
do not die so easily.    
 Lord King!    
    
    
    
    
[Edward] One moment. [groans]    
    
 Lord King, Lady Aelswith is here.
Yes.    
My King, whatever's the matter?    
 Prepare for a new attack.    
The Danes? Or Aethelhelm?
Neither.    
Shorter and more vicious.    
Oh, my dearest son.    
Mother, what happened to your plan
to spirit Aelfwynn away from Mercia?    
It went awry and so I bring grave news.    
Aelfwynn was captured on the road.
By who?    
[Aelswith] We are not certain, but one,
at least, did not survive my wrath.    
We believe them to be hired men.    
[Eadith] We suspect an association
with Lord Aethelhelm.    
Rouse Lord Aldhelm, tell him
I come imminently to discuss the matter.    
Send a command to search for her now!    
What is there to discuss?    
She is your blood and she is in danger.    
And that is to say nothing
of her value to your enemies.    
Edward, why do you hesitate?    
 I'm not hesitating!    
I am simply not rushing blindly
into action.    
Edward, why...
Please do not argue with me, Mother.    
She is Aethelflaed's child!
I am aware of her bloodline.    
But I am also aware of Lord Aethelhelm.    
I will not react with haste to
this provocation, nor chase him blindly.    
We do not even know where he is,    
so allow me to follow what I know
to be the right path.    
    
Oh, you have not had the chance
to meet properly.    
Mother, this is your new...
I will not acknowledge    
whichever harlot you've decided to bed!    
I was going to say this is your new queen.    
[Edward] Eadgifu and I are wed.    
She is with child.    
[Aelswith] Well...    
A... A baby will be a blessing.    
Thank you.    
I... I did not mean to call you, um...    
I would kneel,
but my bones are stiff from...    
No, I quite understand.
You are no longer young in years...    
From slaughtering a man
with my bare hands.    
    
A slight exaggeration.    
I drove a knife through his neck.    
I was not wearing gloves.    
It has been an eventful time.    
Mm. Then you have surely earned
a good rest.    
I will ensure you are given
the grandest chamber in Eoferwic.    
The king and I can sleep elsewhere.    
It is my honor to honor you.    
I hope, in time,
you deem me worthy of your son.    
What has changed within my son, I wonder,    
that he has no appetite
to fight for his niece    
and against Lord Aethelhelm, no less?    
His new bride, perhaps?    
No, I do not think
the king's so easily distracted.    
Then he maneuvers in ways
I simply cannot understand.    
Lady Aelswith,
there is another possibility.    
You have silver.
You could easily buy the men to find her.    
Silver? For the honor
of saving the blood of Alfred?    
 I merely suggest...
Men should be paying me    
for the privilege of fighting in her name.    
[Aelswith] As ever, the Lord provides.    
I have a job for you.    
    
[Eadith] Lord Uhtred, it is Eadith.    
Yes?    
I thought you had left for Frankia.    
 The gods had other ideas.    
It has been quite the journey.    
It is a relief to see you.    
Mm, do not be too hasty.
I bring only trouble.    
I have spoken with your men.    
They say you are returning to Rumcofa.    
I am.    
You are welcome to join us
should you wish.    
That is kind.    
Are you set on this path?    
Yes. I know the men have suffered there,    
but I have to take Stiorra away
from Eoferwic and the lands she has lost.    
A darkness has found her.    
What has happened to her?    
    
I did not stop it.    
I did not protect her.    
Well, perhaps I could talk with her.    
Find a way to cure her heart.    
I'm afraid it's already too late.    
For many years I was not there
when she needed me.    
I gave my life to Wessex and the Saxons.    
This feeling I know.    
My children have suffered.    
I never gave them a chance to live
as a family after they lost their mother.    
I thought that to be absent was to protect
them from the dangers I faced, but...    
I was not a father, not as they deserved.    
Stiorra is being swallowed by a dread.    
I've seen it before. In Brida.    
I've seen what it can do.    
She needs a place to heal,
to become herself again.    
And that place is Rumcofa?    
I do not know, but it is all I have got.    
Why do you ask me of this?
Aelfwynn has been taken by Aethelhelm.    
The king is reluctant to act,
so Lady Aelswith and I were wondering    
if perhaps you might gather your men...
No, Eadith, I cannot.    
She is Lady Aethelflaed's daughter.
You swore to protect her.    
I cannot give myself to others
when my daughter needs me!    
    
Lady Aelswith has silver.    
I've tried to persuade her to buy men,
but she will not. She's...    
The king should look to his duty.    
Not me, not you, the king.    
The king is deaf to it.    
I'm sorry.
I have to take care of my daughter.    
So, what shall I do?    
    
 Uhtred,
whatever you need for this pursuit,    
Mercia will supply.    
I will not be leaving to seek Aelfwynn.
But you must.    
Edward has refused.    
And yet I cannot help Mercia with this.
In time the king will come to his senses.    
Trust that I have my reasons.
Of course.    
But, please, speak with the king
on this matter, he will not heed me on it.    
Despite himself, he listens to you.
[Benedict] Lord Aldhelm!    
 Not today.    
Will you ask for me
to speak with the king?    
I will summon you when the time is right.
 My business is urgent.    
Lord Aethelhelm is fomenting rebellion.
We know this. He will be stopped.    
I'm not so certain.    
He has the Scottish army on his side.    
He has made an alliance with Constantin    
and has offered him
the hand of Lady Aelfwynn.    
Of course. She is to be used in a bargain.    
How do you know this?    
I have heard Aethelhelm
speak of it himself.    
I escorted Lord Aelfweard
to find his grandfather.    
Then you are an enemy of the king.
I know.    
And I will accept
what punishments may come.    
But the threat from Aethelhelm
seemed too great to ignore.    
He is set on war with the king
and the Scots follow him.    
And when Christian realms
turn on each other, I fear all is lost.    
You should leave here. Protect yourself.
I will report your message.    
Lord Aethelhelm, where will we find him?    
In a fortress north of here,
name of Bebbanburg.    
He is the guest of Lord Wihtgar.    
[Aethelhelm] I trust you slept well.    
I did not sleep at all.    
The howling of the wind can unsettle
those softened to such things.    
Please, eat.    
You will find the food
is not what you are used to.    
    
It is the food of my lands.    
And what a bounty your lands provide.    
Why have you brought me here?    
For your protection, child, from the king.    
He would never harm me. I am his blood.    
He has remarried.
The new queen is with child.    
He is creating a new bloodline.    
History has proven, time and again,    
a new regime wants rid
of remnants of the old.    
We are kin. I do not need this protection.    
The king has denied you
the throne your mother left you,    
murder the ealdormen to seat himself.    
His disregard for you is apparent.    
If you were not here, you would surely
already be dead by his hand.    
And to secure your protection,
as your mother would have wished,    
we have found you a husband.    
I am already betrothed
to Cynlaef of Rumcofa.    
[Aethelhelm] A boy from Rumcofa?    
Hardly a match
for a granddaughter of Alfred.    
No, you will marry a king.    
[Aethelhelm] Not him!    
Too much kinship is bad for a bloodline.    
It creates weak men,
and weak men make for weaker kings.    
I speak of Constantin of Scotland.    
An alliance with him
will leave Saxon lands safe.    
I do not wish to be traded like cattle.    
I do not see any other purpose for you.    
You are not a queen.    
You are not a warrior.    
You are, by your own admission,
barely a lady.    
It is a good marriage,
you should be grateful.    
Please, cousin. If you have    
any remaining loyalty to your family...
It is not I who has been disloyal.    
It's my family
who has been disloyal to me.    
I will throw myself from the walls
sooner than marry this man.    
[Aethelhelm] Then do it!    
It will just be one less thing
for me to be concerned with.    
[Aethelhelm] I thought so.
Do not make promises you cannot keep.    
    
What is it that you want of me?    
[Pyrlig] Talking to yourself, Uhtred?    
Or is this you at prayer?    
I think I'm cursed.
Then consider me the curse-slayer.    
Call me a foolish old priest,
but I sense you are troubled.    
Aethelhelm has joined
with the Scots to take Northumbria.    
And he's launching his rebellion
from Bebbanburg.    
    
Now, that is a strange twist of fate.    
    
It's not strange at all.    
My gods are doing it to taunt me,
to tempt me from my duty to my family.    
Why would they do that?    
What've you done?
    
Well, that I never understand.
Mm.    
All I know is that for most of my life,    
I've given my sword to Wessex
and it drew me away from my family.    
Stiorra thinks it was my choice, but...    
 ...I'm not so sure.    
Sometimes I think that my fate
is to wander and to never arrive.    
You've served the House of Wessex
with much honor.    
I've worked hard
for Alfred's ambition, yes.    
But my own kin suffered for it.    
Well, it brought you Aethelflaed.
And then she was taken.    
The gods are cruel.
Mm.    
And now they offer this?    
All life is a test, true.
But my god does not want you to fail.    
Perhaps there is design in this    
that is benevolent.
    
Then perhaps you are not meant to choose
between your fate and Alfred's ambition,    
between your children and his.    
Perhaps you are meant to serve both.    
I cannot serve two masters.    
But what if there's only one master?    
One god, one destiny, many branches.
Yes, yes.    
One tree.
That is where our beliefs differ.    
And this is where I will insist.    
Think about it.    
You retake Bebbanburg and ensure
Northumbria does not fall to the Scots.    
In that act,
you find a home for your bloodline.    
You're saying that it is my destiny
to make England for Edward?    
 That all this wait
for Bebbanburg served a purpose?    
Maybe.
    
Your god has a sense of humor.    
It seems he does.     
And do you want to accept this calling?
    
Yes, I want to accept, but is it a path
of destiny or... or of arrogance?    
Am I being tempted for a fall?    
Perhaps the threads my gods have woven,
perhaps they make a net to snare me?    
And when I failed the first time,
that was the sign that I ignored.    
When Father Beocca was taken...    
It was a sign that Beocca
believed in your mission.    
But perhaps you were not ready.
I felt as ready then as I feel now.    
What if I fail again?
But what if you don't?    
What if you do? If you died
in the doing of it, what would happen?    
All reputation lost, all bloodline left
to roam without protection.    
The shame would be heavy in Valhalla.    
But there is no shame in heaven.    
That is the beauty of it.    
So my advice would be
believe my god is on your side.    
And that you do not walk alone.    
There is no God.
Mm.    
Only the gods.    
    
    
    
Thank you for your kindness.    
You could be right.    
Maybe they are on my side.    
[Constantin] Have you heard from
Lord Aethelhelm?    
Has he taken possession
of the Mercian girl?    
[Domnal] Last night, I hear.    
I'm impressed. I thought perhaps
he'd overplayed his hand.    
[Domnal] I still think it is unwise
to trust a man who betrays his king.    
True.    
But what he offers is sound, so we move
our soldiers closer to the border.    
It may take a while.
There have been floods in Cumbraland.    
Then we do not alert Edward
to our presence    
until all our numbers are gathered.    
When we are as one,
we shall face him down.    
What if he will not be cowed?    
Then he will face a battle he shall lose.    
And in the face of defeat,
he will make us a better offer.    
What, us being the Scots?    
Or us being the alliance
with Lord Aethelhelm?    
[Constantin] I will stand by my word.    
For as long as is necessary.    
[Edward] We will be ready
to move out by the morning.    
Lord King.
I have been informed of Benedict's news.    
But not of my plan, which will return
Aelfwynn and deliver Aethelhelm.    
And as I already told my mother,
this situation requires restraint.    
We are returning to Wessex.
Listen to me. I know how to end this.    
There is no ending to this
that is satisfactory.    
Aethelhelm will be expecting me to lead
an army into battle, it is surely a trap.    
I know, but we have the advantage.    
Father Benedict told us of their plan.    
We have a moment to strike
whilst they're unprepared.    
It would be foolish not to use it.
I can assure you I am not foolish.    
Only unwilling to behave
as my enemies dictate.    
So we divide those enemies.
We leave immediately,    
we cut off Constantin
before he even reaches Bebbanburg.    
If I can intercept him
and stop the incursion, then...    
Aethelhelm would be without allies
at Bebbanburg.    
He may control the household guard,
but they'd be no match    
for the Mercian army. It would not
be easy to breach the fortress.    
[Uhtred] But it is possible
if we're our full number.    
I lead the men of Wessex and we push
the Scots back over the border.    
Meanwhile, Aethelhelm will be forced
to surrender and Aelfwynn returned.    
But what will stop Constantin from making
another incursion in years to come?    
You fortify the lands north of Bebbanburg
and I hold them for you.    
Uhtred, Lord of Bebbanburg,
just as you always wanted.    
[Edward] And you hold it alone?
Not alone.    
I take it you're not heading
to Rumcofa after all, Lord.    
We heard from Lady Aelswith that there may
be something you might need our help with.    
You have found the men I sought to return
Aelfwynn when you refused, I see?    
 Yes,
thank you very much for this.    
So, then, when you are dead,
who holds the north after you?    
Your seedless son,
or a child of Stiorra the Dane?    
I cannot speak for my daughter.    
No, you cannot.    
Uhtred's plan has much to commend it,    
but still this is not
the correct course of action.    
You're going to allow the marriage
to take place? Edward!    
I'm going to make Constantin an offer
in exchange for Aethelhelm's head.    
He is the greater threat to our kingdom.    
Northumbria is a land much disputed
between us and the Scots.    
Until a settlement is made, there will be
no peace and those that will suffer    
are not those in this room,
but farmers, fishermen, families.    
I am a king for all Saxons,
not king to one man.    
And though I owe that man a debt,
I cannot put that debt    
nor that man's ambition
above the lives of my people.    
Constantin's reputation
is that of a man who seeks    
to protect Scotland at all costs,
above all else.    
So, I will come to an agreement with him.    
In exchange for marrying Aelfwynn
and isolating Lord Aethelhelm,    
we will divide Northumbria in two,    
to create an area of fortification
around the Scottish border.    
You would split Northumbria!    
These are lands my forebears died for.
Saxon lands!    
Now, finally, you're a Saxon?    
The people there speak your language.    
They were once two kingdoms.
It has been thus before.    
The lands around Bebbanburg
fall to the Scots    
and Aethelhelm is disposed of.    
With Aelfwynn sacrificed alongside him?
Not a palatable choice, but sensible.    
If Northumbria is divided,    
you forfeit any chance to create
the kingdom your father hoped for.    
Yes, but in return, I will bring peace    
to a land larger and more unified
than he ever achieved.    
I have ended the tyranny
of bloody succession the people endured.    
Now they thrive
under the protection of a man,    
who does not take their deaths lightly.    
Lord King, your choice has no honor.
[Edward] No honor?    
To forego my chance to unify all
of these lands for the sake of my people?    
To put aside my father's dream, the dream
of my family, to ensure that we prosper?    
That is not honor. That is martyrdom.    
If the people wish to reward me
in their prayers, that is their will.    
My father's ambition failed them
in the end. I do not have his failings.    
It was not ambition, it was vision.
Visions are nothing more than dreams.    
Only a fool would chase them.    
[Uhtred] I think that you are afraid.    
Of war, of death.    
You're afraid.    
Only a fool would not be.    
And I am not a fool.    
[Aldhelm] No.    
Lord King, this is callous,    
to Aelfwynn and to all those
in Northumbria who are Saxon.    
Mercia owes both a debt of loyalty.    
Mercia is best served
when the south is secure.    
Not at the expense of the north.    
Aethelflaed would listen to Uhtred now.    
[Aldhelm] As must we.    
And I gave your sister my word
that I would keep Aelfwynn safe.    
I will not sacrifice her as you do now!    
And nor will the Mercian army.    
I stand with Uhtred.
[Edward] Well, there we have it.    
Not only Lord Aethelhelm
who seeks to rebel.    
[Pyrlig] With respect, Lord King...    
it is not only Lord Aldhelm
who believes you to be wrong.    
There are good people in Northumbria.
They are your people.    
You owe them your protection.    
We stand with Uhtred.    
[Aelswith] It is not
that you are wrong, my son.    
It is that you are simply mistaken
on this occasion.    
Whilst your arguments are considered...    
I would urge you to follow
the counsel of Lord Uhtred.    
Your father trusted his judgment,
as should you.    
    
    
Aethelstan, my boy,
what do you say?     
Should we take a fight to the Scots,
risking decades of conflict,    
or seek a solution that profits both sides
yet denies Uhtred his ancestral home?    
You do not have to answer, Aethelstan.
[Edward] And yet he should.    
Since Aelfweard
has shown himself disloyal...    
Aethelstan could be the king
to face the Scots.    
What do you say, Aethelstan?    
    
Our faith teaches us to speak the truth.    
It teaches us to seek peace.    
And that all Christians must unite.    
To abandon those in your kingdom...    
divide their lands...    
that is not unity.    
    
I will follow Lord Uhtred.    
Not sure things are going your way,
Lord King.     
As I told you, Uhtred,
you do not walk alone.    
    
We gather an army...     
[Sihtric] Whoa, whoa, whoa!
    
[Edward] I will brook no more defiance.    
I am a just king,
but think on those who I have crushed.    
Think on the ealdormen.
Think of Sigtryggr.    
The gates will be closed to all.    
No one will leave on penalty of execution.    
Then the Mercian Guard will be ordered
to ram the gate down.    
You can try to fight us, Lord King,
but we will fight back.    
You delay and we lose the advantage.    
So, you can join our mission
or you can flounder here.    
But we will be gone by sunrise.    
[Uhtred] Choose!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SEASON: 05
EPISODE: 07
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[Uhtred] I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred. 
Aethelhelm has succeeded in starting
a war between Saxon and Dane. 
But his treachery was discovered. 
Sigtryggr did not kill the queen.  
It was the work of Aethelhelm's men.  
[Edward] He must be apprehended.  
[Uhtred] Seeking to weaken
the Saxon forces, 
Sigtryggr marched boldly into battle
and took the fight Aethelhelm's men. 
But Edward's arrival turned the tide. 
I rode for peace and Sigtryggr
has repaid us with more bloodshed.   
They must be saved!   
   
[Uhtred] While Aethelhelm escaped,
Sigtryggr was taken prisoner. 
You must accept the gift of baptism.   
[Stiorra]
I cannot.   
[Uhtred] And I was given the gravest duty. 
You must be the one to do it.   
[Uhtred] That Sigtryggr
might reach Valhalla. 
Brida's desire for vengeance
is as strong as ever. 
   
Tell him I'm coming for him.
   
[Uhtred] And a new threat
has emerged in the north. 
King Constantin of Scotland
has formed an alliance 
with the lords of Northumbria,
disputed territory he claims as his own. 
This is a moment to join as one.   
[Uhtred] Among them is my cousin Wihtgar, 
who murder his father
to steal my birthright for himself. 
Destiny is all! 
   
   
[Wolland] My queen.   
[Stiorra] Do not forget me on this,
your final journey.   
Your blade and my heart...
will remain yours.   
   
   
   
Tonight all love is buried.   
   
   
   
   
[Stiorra]
Sigtryggr, you lived as a warrior!   
And you died... a king!   
 Sigtryggr!   
   
We should unite in grief.   
My grief is that you lived and he did not.   
Leave her be.   
[Stiorra] May we die as you did!   
With honor in our hearts
and laughter in our throats!   
May you sail safely to Valhalla...
   
...where we will drink with you again!   
We will meet again!   
To Valhalla!   
To Sigtryggr!   
 To Sigtryggr!   
To Sigtryggr!   
   
   
Have you seen Father?   
The Warrior Priest of Rumcofa.   
He showed great courage.   
And made Osferth proud.   
I have heard of your bravery.
Let us drink to it.   
I bring news I do not wish to break.   
Brida has struck again.   
If he survives the night,
he does so at God's mercy.   
We're all here, Pyrlig.
You are with friends.   
Uhtred... she wants to punish you.   
She will not rest.   
   
Fetch Aethelstan. We will need his guard.   
We'll hunt her down. We'll kill her.   
   
   
Have they found the witch?
No, Lord King.   
And how does one woman hide
from the Mercian Guard?   
I do not know,
but Uhtred and his men will find her.   
And Aethelhelm,
does he still wander my lands?   
Also no news as yet.
Rumors he is heading south.   
Of course he is.
He will try to raise a rebellion.   
   
[Edward] Can Pyrlig travel?
No.   
Then we shall have to leave him here.   
Is it wise to leave Eoferwic
while Brida roams?   
It depends on your feelings
towards Aethelhelm seizing Winchester.   
That will be his plan. We must get south.   
Was Aelfweard informed
of Aethelhelm's treachery?   
We felt that was news for you to break.   
Indeed, my son has been
through far too much of late   
and to hear of this
would only wound him further.   
Lord, I understand your reasons to leave,   
but I must stress
I am concerned for Eoferwic.   
You saw yourself
the atmosphere is febrile.   
Indeed.
How differently the Danes mark death.   
If we abandon Eoferwic,   
then our men who died defeating Sigtryggr
will have done so for nothing.   
Secure Eoferwic...   
and we have the opportunity to foray
further north, bring the entirety    
of Northumbria under your command,
fulfil the dream of every Saxon...    
It will mean nothing
if we lose Wessex to Aethelhelm.    
The people here are volatile,
the mood not favorable.    
Much pain is felt for the Lady Stiorra    
and I fear her grief
could ferment more trouble.    
Add Brida to that and...
The air is poisoned. I understand.    
If sympathy for the young widow
is the problem, that can be resolved.    
Summon Lord Uhtred.    
Do not ask. We did not find her.    
Perhaps she's left these lands.    
Pyrlig could not have traveled far
with his injuries. She's still near.    
She knows that to return
to Eoferwic means certain death.    
She's ruthless, but she's not foolish.    
Rest the horses. We will ride out again.    
Uhtred, you are summoned to the King.    
There is no news. That is the news.    
Nonetheless, his word stands. Come.    
    
[Edward] Lord Uhtred.    
I bring you nothing.    
No Brida, no Aethelhelm,
no change in Pyrlig.    
[Edward] How then are the Danes?    
Danes of Eoferwic.    
Since when have you cared for them?    
Since I became their king.    
I know it sounds a little strange.
To rule Danes was not my expectation.    
You've always coveted these lands.    
Indeed, but my hope was
that a conquest would be peaceful,    
that the people would live side by side.    
That became difficult
when you martyred their king.    
Yes. I see the King's widow has a grief
that would move the stoniest of hearts.    
She's young. She loved him very much.    
She has lost a great deal,
her future, her status, her home.    
All of which she would forgo
to have the man.    
Still, her grief
could become a touchstone.    
Perhaps it is wise
she hide it a little better.    
That is impossible.    
Perhaps then I can offer her a salve.    
I need to take my household south,
to sit again on the throne in Wessex.    
You fear Aethelhelm...
I fear no one.    
But I suspect Aethelhelm
will fuel dissent,    
which is why I need Eoferwic at peace.    
Tell that to Brida.
I'm sure she will comply with your wishes.    
I do not expect Brida to comply,
but I would hope Stiorra might.    
What is it you want her to do?    
Tell her to swear to me, publicly,
to bring comfort to the Danes    
that all is resolved between us.    
The people here
have endured too much for that.    
We have all endured too much.    
She could lead the Danes
as your sister led in Mercia.    
It could give her some purpose.
It could restore something...    
As long as her purpose
is not to lead them against me.    
I do not think
she has an appetite for rebellion.    
But she will not take a baptism.    
My father ensured
she was baptized as a girl,    
so she is already saved.    
I see no need to do that again.    
I must be acknowledged
as the true overlord of Eoferwic.    
And in return, she has your protection?    
Yes.
[Uhtred] Then I will tell her to comply.    
Thank you, Lord King.    
It is an honor
I know my daughter will not be expecting.    
If we cannot honor our greatest warriors,
we cannot be great kings.    
God is merciful. That is her horse.
She will be close by.    
Wait here in case she returns to it.
We will look for her.    
Lady Aelfwynn? It is you.
You are Aelfwynn of Mercia.    
You, you confuse me for another.    
Surely not. I am, I am Glaedwine.
I too am of Mercia.    
I was errand boy to your mother.    
My heart grieves for your loss.    
If you did once serve my mother,
then do as I ask and leave me alone.    
My lady, are you in trouble?    
My grandmother would imprison me
in a convent for my own safety.    
Then it is well that our paths
have crossed, my lady.    
I have been tasked to serve you
and to protect you.    
Tasked by whom?    
Someone who cares for you very much.    
Cynlaef? He lives?    
He's been searching for you.
I thought he was...    
Well, let us make haste.
I fear Lady Aelswith's guard are near.    
Where is he? Where's Cynlaef?    
This way, my lady.    
    
[Glaedwine] Go on.    
[Bresal] Lady Aelfwynn?    
I thought you said Cynlaef
was going to be here.    
Never trust a handsome man,
my lady Aelfwynn.    
They only want to hump you, or rob you.    
There. The elder is the man
who approached me in Aegelesburg,    
who offered me silver for Aelfwynn.    
We have met before, have we not?    
Lady Eadith.    
One alehouse whore is much like another.    
She is no whore.    
It is unwise to insult a lady
who travels defended by Mercian Guard.    
She's no friend of yours.    
She took silver from me
in exchange for news of your whereabouts.    
Then may your charity be returned
in exchange for Aelfwynn.    
This is no business of yours, witch.    
[Aelswith] Perhaps not of hers,    
but as Aelfwynn is my granddaughter,
it is most definitely business of mine.    
Lady Aelswith, I did not recognize you.    
It is an honor to keep the company
of your granddaughter.    
You may keep the silver
as reward for finding her.    
He was too reasonable.    
You underestimate how men crumble
in the face of Alfred's widow.    
Anyway, fear not, our guards are close.    
    
    
It would be ill-advised
to cry out for help.    
    
I ask for just one moment!
I wish only to speak to her as a brother!    
And yet the word of her father
must come first.    
Please tell me Brida is your captive.    
I cannot.    
Then tell me she will be mine
so that I may punish her.    
She is the source of all our sorrows.    
Then do not think on her.    
Better to think on the one who started it
than on the one who dealt the final blow.    
I'm in grief for Sigtryggr, too,
and you know this.    
You have been wronged by many things,
but this anger will destroy you.    
Destroy what? I am nothing.
A wife to no one, a queen to nowhere.    
Yet you are still a daughter...    
with a father who would do anything
to make this right.    
I cannot raise the dead,
but I can raise you from your grief.    
I think you could find
some solace in comfort.    
That is all I want, Father.
And so there is an offer.    
Edward proposes that you be lady here
and rule for him in his stead.    
You would not be queen,
but Eoferwic would look to you.    
What does Edward want in return?    
You must swear allegiance and forgive...
I do not forgive. I cannot in my heart.    
Then forgive with your mouth
and let your heart keep silent.    
I am no more an oath-breaker than you are.    
Yes, but you are a woman alone
and I am not.    
As your father,
I can offer some protection.    
But the day will come...
When you'll be called elsewhere    
and I will be left as a target,
as was always true.    
Please, see that you need to do this.    
For you to thrive, I want you to accept.    
Who are they? Why have they taken us?    
Your uncle wants you concealed
so you do not threat the Mercian throne.    
No, my son is shrewd    
and if he felt she was a threat,
he would keep her close.    
Not use hired men on the road.    
Only a wealthy coward would pay men to...    
Oh, you foolish woman.    
Aethelhelm.    
He is as rich as he is cunning.    
Only he would be so bold
to arrange the seizing of a lady,    
a former queen and a...    
Well, he did not know
you were going to be here.    
That is a great comfort.
What would Aethelhelm want with me?    
I do not know, but I am certain
I have no wish to find out.    
[Aelfwynn] How do we resist?    
We have no weapon, no plan.    
That is not completely true.    
People have come for my life
on other occasions.    
Of course I am schooled
in how to protect myself.    
    
    
Aelfwynn, do not fear.    
They look at us and they see
weak and feeble women,    
but therein lies our strength.    
Aethelhelm and his men
are fools to underestimate us.    
[Yahya] We have pledged our allegiance.
Why does the king not let us leave?    
He is swinging his cock around.    
I'm not even certain he has a plan.    
You think there will be war with Wessex?    
No.    
Peace serves both kings better.    
We stay here, kiss arses, go home.    
    
That old goat's not of Northumbria.    
Just another lord whose balls
hang lower than his coin purse.    
Lord King.    
    
They call me the Dane-humper,
but I'm fairly sure they're assassins.    
 You Edward's ambassador?    
I am from Wessex, yes. Lord Aethelhelm.    
Well, show me the gift.    
My humble apologies, Lord King,
there is no gift.    
No toe of St. Cuthbert
or bread from the Last Supper?    
The king is not sure you appreciate
holy relics in Scotland.     
Hm.    
Did he tell you to say that?    
To insult me?    
Forgive me. I'm just the messenger.    
    
I've heard of his conquest of Mercia.    
Does the treaty I made
with Aethelflaed still stand?    
The king has not spoken to me of a treaty.    
Then he intends to come north?    
Again, not something he has spoken of.    
Why send an ambassador
who claims to know nothing?    
What game is this?    
Does he want me to cut your head off
and send it back?    
    
Lord King, you seem to be a man
who knows the quality of mercy.    
I therefore throw myself
upon your compassion.    
[Aethelhelm]
I come to give you fair warning.    
Of?    
I fear King Edward's eye
wanders northwards...    
to Northumbria and to Scotland.    
And these ambitions are not shared by me.    
    
So you're telling me this
out of the goodness of your heart.    
No.    
I do not need warning.    
We are already prepared.    
Half the lords of Northumbria
are sworn to me.    
So if it is war you wish to avert,    
you have picked
the wrong king to dissuade.    
You misunderstand me.
I do not come for peace.    
Well, what, then? What is this trickery?    
It's a bluff.    
I know Edward is your family,
husband to your daughter!    
And that...    
that is the thing.    
Forgive me, Lord King,
for she was murder!    
News of the queen's death
had yet to reach my ears.    
Edward would have Wessex believe
it was Danes.    
    
    
So...    
it is vengeance you seek?    
Lord King, if I...    
The king is merciless
in his pursuit of land.    
You see that
from his disposal of the ealdormen,    
his behavior toward Sigtryggr.    
He sees enemies everywhere,
even in my grandson, his heir,    
Aelfweard, a sweet Christian boy,    
whose ambitions would stretch
no further than Wessex and Mercia.    
What plan are you trying to sell me,
Lord Aethelhelm?    
You help me raise rebellion
against the king,    
we put my grandson
on the throne in Wessex.    
Aelfweard, under my guidance,
guarantees no incursions into Scotland.    
Your lands are safe, as are his.    
I have no interest in playing kingmaker
in Saxon lands.    
One king is much like another.    
Which is why we would offer
more than just a treaty.    
We would offer half the profits
from the lands of Mercia    
through a marriage bond
to the Lady Aelfwynn.    
The lands are
prosperous and fertile, as is the girl.    
Edward is dangerous
and committed to expansion.    
He is haunted
by this dream of his father's,    
to unite the kingdoms
in one so-called England.    
If you do not strike now...    
the opportunity may not arise again.    
    
Leave me to dwell on it
and speak to my commanders.    
But do not go far.    
You have intrigued me, Lord Aethelhelm.    
And that is no inconsiderable feat.    
I can do it when they're asleep.
They will know nothing of it.    
We let them live, it will not be a guard
chasing us. It will be an army.    
killing royal women does not end well.
This I know.    
But you are right.
If we do not, we will be hunted.    
They are planning to kill us.    
We do not know that.    
We are too powerful
to be left to tell the tale.    
They know what forces I can raise.    
If we are going to act, it has to be now.    
I, um...    
[Aelfwynn] I must...    
I have no polite word for it.    
Take a piss?    
    
That oak needs watering.    
Where she can be witnessed?    
It wouldn't do well
to deliver your cargo soiled, would it?    
Walk.    
 Now.    
    
Where are you taking us?
Sit down.    
To whom are we to be delivered?    
[Eadith] Answer me.    
Sit down.    
Or I will make you sit down. Huh?    
    
    
    
    
    
Do not fight it!    
    
    
Death is the destiny of all men.    
    
    
We are not men,
and we are not so easy to kill!    
    
    
    
[Aelswith] Did you see?    
I felt like Saint Michael the Archangel
when he slew Satan's armies.    
Begone or I shall slay you also!    
    
Aelfwynn! Run!    
    
No! Grandmother! Help me! Grandmother!    
    
    
Have them prepare for a ceremony.    
Invite whichever Danes
are most appropriate.    
Stiorra can swear as they bear witness.    
It should calm the waters.
It's a wise plan.    
Why is there not a place set
for Lady Eadgifu?    
It was my understanding
you had sent her away.    
No, that is not correct.    
Well, her servants were told
not to unpack but to turn back.    
    
[Edward] Why did they not unpack?
My Lord.    
My Lord, I am returning to Cent.    
I am not at ease here.    
My love, I would not bring you
somewhere that was not safe.    
It is not any danger I fear.
It is your wrath.    
    
So, please, let me on my way.
It is for the best.    
Why do you flee me now?    
I'm not fleeing you.    
I am sparing you the trouble
of sending me away.    
We have been both blessed and cursed.    
No, it cannot be. It shall not stand.
There can be no more bastards.    
I understand, which is why I leave.    
Why do you speak so coldly?    
Would you have me weep and bawl?
I am not a mewling babe.    
    
I knew what I did    
and...    
I take my punishment proudly
to give thanks to God    
for the small time we have had together.    
I said...    
there can be no more bastards.    
God has blessed us.    
I know not why, but...    
perhaps this is the reason
we have suffered so much grief.    
Perhaps the taking of Aelflaed
was part of this design.    
Perhaps he decided that we are to be wed.    
Let us fetch a priest.    
Love is patient and is...    
The love kind.    
Love not copies.    
Not being boastful. Not arrogant.    
 Amen.    
So soon, Father?
Aelfweard.    
My mother replaced
while she lies warm in her grave?    
God has sent us an unexpected blessing.    
So I am to be replaced also.    
Aelfweard, return.    
I command you come back here!    
Allow him to grieve his mother.    
Find him. Comfort him.    
But remind him of his duty.    
I shall not stomach a disobedient child.    
    
I have been asked to comfort you.    
There is no comfort, Father.    
The king loves you.    
Talk with him and you will know it.    
His actions speak differently.    
He does not want me to be king,
and he felt no love for my poor mother.    
What can I do, child,
heal your spirit, hm?    
Seek help from me and you will find it.    
There is one thing, but you will refuse.    
[Benedict] Ask.    
I need to travel from here.    
If I journey with a priest, I am less
likely to be questioned or troubled.    
Journey to where?    
To join my grandfather.    
I cannot help you.    
I do not know where he is.    
But I do.    
I know how to find him,    
I know which men he pays and who to ask.    
I only request
that I do not travel to him alone.    
Much as I seek to soothe your troubles,
I urge you to stay.    
And I would urge you
to pay your debt to my grandfather.    
He tells me of those who are his men,
who owe him favors.    
I am not Lord Aethelhelm's man.    
Would the king see it that way?    
If I told him of the debt...    
[Uhtred] Are you prepared?
[Stiorra] No.    
Why must I be paraded like a prize?
It is a show of unity, nothing more.    
Do this one thing and it is over.    
You can resume your life here,
live as a lady.    
I know how hard this is,    
but pride is what drove Brida
to the darkness.    
    
    
[Aldhelm] Kneel before your king.    
[Stiorra]    
I know that it is wise for me to kneel.    
But my heart will not allow it.    
[Stiorra]    
I am sorry.    
[Edward] I was told you were agreed.    
I was trying to honor my father's wish.    
But to honor him
is to dishonor my husband.    
And it is a destruction of everything
we have built here in Eoferwic.    
I do not believe
you will let Danes live here in peace.    
If you will not show loyalty to the king,
then you will face the consequence.    
Do not do this.
You have done this to humiliate me.    
I returned to you your dignity.
You would have lived in comfort.    
The only thing I want
you cannot give to me.    
Stiorra, this is foolish...
No!    
I will not crumble just to be protected.    
I will be free.    
And if that freedom is only to face
the executioner's blade, then so be it!    
I shall join my husband.
No!    
Lord King, you gave your word
on the battlefield    
that her life would be spared.    
You and all who follow you
are to be exiled from Eoferwic.    
Those who wish to stay live at my behest!    
But if you are not gone by sunset...    
I will not be so generous.    
Stiorra!
Bring Rognvaldr to me! Have him kneel!    
Put a sword to his throat if he does not!    
Give me time. I can make this right.
Rognvaldr will betray you.    
You know this...
Then I shall execute him    
and find another and another and another    
until I can turn my back
on this wretched town forever.    
I advise you do the same.    
Stiorra.    
Edward now offers Eoferwic to Rognvaldr.    
You want this for your people?    
He will make war, take tribute,
use the children as his slaves,    
just as he meant to
when he brought Brida here.    
You give this to him,
you undo all we have fought for.    
He abuses the people and the people
leave in search of their true queen.    
Rognvaldr will rule nothing.
They shall come to me.    
Please do not lose everything
in a futile pursuit of dignity.    
I am your daughter.    
I was bred to follow honor.    
Do not make me do things
that you would not.    
Swearing to the Saxons
pulled you from your destiny,    
made you the plaything of Brida
and the arseling of the House of Wessex.    
What?
That fate will not be mine.    
    
 Hey, drop your sword!    
Please go to her. Speak with her.
She will not listen to me.    
Her heart is broken, as is her spirit.    
I will pray for her instead.
Why is she doing this?    
What made her so headstrong?    
Do you really not know?
    
Lord, it's Brida.    
 She has a message for you.
Speak it.    
 It was to meet at Loidis.    
Come alone.    
That's it? Loidis? Nothing more?    
No.
I know where she is.    
Lord...
Lord, do not do this alone. It's a trap.    
Of course it is a trap.    
Our destinies have been entwined
since we were children.    
Either she kills me or I kill her.    
Take a moment to consider this.    
Oh, believe me,
it has been on my mind a long while.    
kill her and her death will haunt you.    
Instead you can choose compassion.    
I have compassion
for the innocents she kills.    
If I had taken her life before then...
It is not our place to reason why.    
Only to forgive Brida in spite of it.    
Hate only begets more hate.    
Every death she has caused
since I spared her at Tettenhall    
is blood on my hands.    
Then you must absolve her of blame
and yourself.    
Or you will never find peace.    
Swear to me.
Swear to me you will not kill her.    
Take her captive.
Make her face those she has wronged.    
Father, do not kill her.    
I will take no pleasure in it.    
It is just the way things must be.    
Open the gates!    
    
Good, you are both here.    
Lord King, I think our discussions would
be wisest had between the two of us...    
We've agreed the principles. Lord Wihtgar
here will help us with the practicalities.    
You will escort Lord Aethelhelm
to your fortress as a guest.    
There he will prepare the betrothal
and await my arrival.    
You will give him every courtesy
because he has promised me much    
and would not be so foolish
as to not deliver.    
We swore allegiance to you,
Lord King, not...    
Lord Wihtgar...    
I cannot place you.    
I'm presuming your fortress
is one of strategic use.    
You've probably heard of it.    
It's called Bebbanburg.    
You are the man that torments Uhtred?
    
    
I had expected someone different.    
    
[Uhtred] Brida!    
Show yourself!    
You dig your own grave?    
Mine    
or yours.    
I'm prepared.    
Either way, it ends where it began.    
It did not have to be this way.    
Funny.    
That's what your son said
when he begged to keep his balls.    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
[Brida] At some point,
I will see you on the battlefield. 
I won't hesitate to kill you.    
It does not mean you do not love me.    
    
Uhtred! Give me death.    
Vibeke is waiting for me.    
    
    
Stop this! It is over.    
It is never over!    
    
    
    
    
    
    
Uhtred.    
Uhtred, kill me. Come on!    
Come on. You must kill me.
I have nothing left to live for!    
I won't stop, Uhtred.    
    
[Brida] Something has died
within me, Uhtred.    
What are you waiting for? kill me, please.    
No!     
I will not kill you.    
If my son could forgive you
after what you have done to him...    
    
...then I must do the same.    
No. No, come on. No, do it.
Do it, you coward.    
Do it. Do as I ask for.
Send me to Valhalla.    
Do it!
 No!    
To kill you
would be to kill part of myself!    
We were bound as one!    
We were the same.    
As there was hope before,
there can be hope again.    
How?    
We can't go back.    
Everything good we ever had is destroyed.    
There's nothing left, Uhtred.    
    
You're talking through your arse.    
Now you sound like the girl
who I chased through these woods    
and humped amongst these trees.    
    
The girl that I loved.    
She's there still.    
Is she?    
I can't find her.    
    
    
I will help you.    
    
Trust me.    
    
    
    
    
 Brida.    
What have you done?!    
Only what you could not!    
 I'm sorry.    
I...    
I'm cold.    
No.    
    
Ragnar.    
Brida.    
 No!    
Brida!    
Brida...

SEASON: 05
EPISODE: 06
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[Uhtred] I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred. 
Aethelhelm plotted to unseat King Edward 
and put his grandson Aelfweard
on the throne. 
You are a fine and true young man
who will one day be a mighty king.  
He planned to have the visionary Aalys
killed on her pilgrimage to Lindisfarne. 
And blamed the murder on the Danes. 
You do realize this could start a war
between Christian and Dane.  
Hopefully, yes.  
[Uhtred] But unknown to him, his daughter,
Queen Aelflaed, journeyed with Aalys. 
I am the visionary!   
[Haesten] Who did this?   
They were sent from the king of Jorvik.
They said Sigtryggr wanted vengeance.   
Despite Brida taking Father Pyrlig
as her prisoner, 
a bond has formed between them. 
I accept your offer of safe passage
and protection.   
Take me to Uhtred.   
[Uhtred] Aelswith has made a new plan
to protect her granddaughter, Aelfwynn. 
I have chosen you a husband,
someone you know. I will explain.   
[Uhtred] Aethelhelm's men marched
on the Danes of Rumcofa in revenge 
for the attack on the pilgrims.
   
   
[Uhtred] Osferth was among those
who fell defending them. 
Aethelhelm has discovered
what his plotting has cost him. 
[Bresal] Your daughter was traveling
with the pilgrims.   
And was also slaughtered.   
[Uhtred] And ow, both King Edward
and Sigtryggr prepare for war. 
His wife... for mine.   
 Sigtryggr! Sigtryggr!
Sigtryggr...   
[Uhtred] Destiny, is all! 
[Stiorra] Edward knows nothing
of what he's unleashed.   
Truly he has stirred the hornet's nest.   
Two days!   
In two days we mount the heads
of Saxon turds on spikes!   
   
Brother...   
I have spoken with the men and all agree.
We should surprise them on the road.   
No. The king has chosen the battle site.   
Sigtryggr, they outnumber us.   
If Edward thinks numbers will win this,
his arrogance will be his undoing.   
He believes we're at his mercy.
It is not wise, brother.   
[Sigtryggr] But it is necessary,
Rognvaldr.   
Our people will paint the land
with Saxon blood.   
If you're afraid, you may stand down.   
All who fight as brothers, fight as one.   
[Sigtryggr] We attack from the high hill!   
   
[Edward] Sigtryggr hopes that by attacking
from high terrain, he can overwhelm us. 
But we will turn his attack
to our advantage.   
We launch our assault here with     men.   
Danes attack, yes, but it will give us
the time to move here   
and take out their vanguard.   
Those men will most likely be lost.   
Then they shall be lost with honor.   
It is the price we must pay to protect
our kingdoms from the heathens.   
Ensure Lord Aethelhelm is located
and told of our intentions.   
[Bresal] King Edward is camped    miles
from here and the Danes are marching.   
The men grow tired of waiting,
but they remain loyal.   
[Aethelhelm] Good. Then we wait.   
In Edward's hour of need,
we ride to the Saxons' aid.   
We must watch the young Aethelstan.
Keep him close.   
There are those
that have ambitions for the boy.   
You are now Aelfweard's one true ally.   
Yes.   
Let us therefore pray my daughter's
sacrifice may yet bear fruit.   
Keep an eye on Aethelstan.   
[Sihtric] Lord, we must rest the horses.   
Eat faster. We have men to kill.   
Edward will have camped north.   
[Finan] What if he's already moved on?
[Uhtred] Then we catch up to him.   
We find the king
and then we seize Aethelhelm.   
Each man take a limb
and we tear him into quarters.   
There are only three of us, Lord.   
Osferth's spirit will stand in place.   
His spirit is busy taunting
the fool that got him killed.   
You're not guilty of this, Finan.   
Save your anger for the ones that are.
   
Aethelhelm will get what is coming to him.   
But first we must avert this war.   
   
   
We cannot linger here.   
Where is Cynlaef?   
Perhaps he resists the offer of my hand.   
Unlikely. You allowed him to touch you.
He will want more.   
That is just the way of young men.   
Besides, he has been given an order.   
Do not pull that face.   
We all want this whole ghastly affair
to be over.   
I'm sure Cynlaef will not let you down.   
 My lady,
one of your guard approaches.   
[Aelswith] I know this man. He is loyal.   
Redwald, what news do you bring?   
[Redwald] There has been
a massacre in Rumcofa, my lady.   
Countless Danes put to the sword.   
Men and women both,
children and the elderly.   
Who carried out this attack?
We cannot be certain.   
But there have been rumors.
Some say war is coming.   
These lands are no longer safe.   
Cynlaef may yet still live.
[Aelswith] We cannot linger here longer.    
I must get you to safety.    
    
[Brida] Shh, there are men in the trees.    
Warriors.    
    
[Pyrlig] They are merely scouts,
resting on their journey.    
    
I thought it was an ambush.
 They won't harm us.    
Did you think I intended to murder you?    
The thought did cross my mind.    
You're no use to me dead.
So why did you stay just now?    
I need you to speak for me
when I stand before Uhtred.    
Or perhaps you despise me
less than I thought.    
    
Your company's torturous.
I've had boils I liked better.    
I see.    
I'll go and speak with them.
Perhaps they have news.    
I will not let you lock me away
in a convent!    
It is safe there.    
This morning I was to be wedded    
and now I am being banished to a place
of chastity and prayers at dawn!    
Things have changed.
It is our only option.    
You would not treat my mother
with such torment.    
You are not her.    
You simply wish to be rid of me.    
How can you say such things?    
I have done my very best to protect you...
And you have utterly failed me.    
As you did my mother.    
Gather your things.
We depart before the day is ended.    
If we have to travel by darkness,
so be it!    
Ensure she does not leave this room.
Yes, my lady.    
I shall not go!    
And you cannot keep me here
against my will!    
It saddens me to hear of this massacre.    
Rumcofa was a haven for many.
No longer. We ride now for Aegelesburg.    
We wish to be as far as possible
from this bloodshed.    
And Edward is coming north?
He's already on the road.    
The kingdoms are in turmoil.    
The peace that existed between
Saxon and Dane has ended.    
They're at war.    
It is time for us to take our leave,
unless you need any assistance.    
No.    
My companion and I have all we need.    
What news did he offer?    
[Pyrlig] Nothing of importance,
but we should set out at once.    
[Brida] What's the hurry?    
Honestly...
I cannot wait to escape this blasted cold.    
Besides, the sooner
we meet with Uhtred the better.    
More sent from the northern burhs.    
[Edward] We look strong.    
Lord King, we bring grave news.    
Sigtryggr did not kill the queen.    
It was the work of Aethelhelm's men.    
Send for Sigtryggr!
 Yes, Lord.    
[Wolland] Our scouts say
it's not Edward's camp.    
The banners belong to one of his lords.    
Perhaps the gods are speaking to us.    
Perhaps we can use this.    
Edward's chances dwindle
with fewer allies on the field.    
[Stiorra] The king's forces
can afford to lose men.    
Can we?    
They have scouts.
They'll see you coming around the lake.    
We need not go around the lake.
It's frozen.    
We could go over it.    
[Edward] No Saxon would ever condemn
his daughter to such an end. 
[Uhtred] He did not order her death.    
It was the visionary Aalys
he sought to kill.    
When the moment came, the queen
sacrificed herself to save the girl.    
Do you have proof of this?
[Uhtred] I have spoken to Aalys.    
I've seen the horror in her eyes.
And Sigtryggr had no part in this?    
He could not have planned it.
No one knew the Queen traveled.    
The country is full of spies.    
What reason would Sigtryggr have to attack
a farm girl and then deny it?    
Lord, Aethelhelm must be hunted down
and brought to justice.    
Aelflaed's blood is on his hands.    
As is Osferth's...    
your father's natural son.    
He was one of my most loyal men.    
He fought at my side for Wessex
through countless battles.    
I'm sorry to hear it.    
Only Aethelhelm benefits from this chaos.    
He wants you to turn
to him and his armies,    
so he may strut again
in the palace in Winchester.    
He must be apprehended.    
A rider was dispatched to find him
and will soon return.    
Send word to Aegelesburg.    
Aelfweard is to be shielded
from his grandfather's influence    
and protected by my personal guard.    
That order should extend to Aethelstan.    
He stands between
Aelfweard and the throne.    
I sent Aethelstan to find Aethelhelm.    
Then he is in danger.    
What of the war with Sigtryggr?    
Tell Sigtryggr our conflict is over.    
My quarrel now is with Aethelhelm.    
Your strategy at Lindcylne was a good one.
Why abandon it for uncertainty?    
Because I hear your words.    
We do not have men to spare.    
This stealth attack could destroy hundreds
of Saxons with little loss of Dane life.    
It is a gift.    
Or a trap! What if the ice doesn't hold?    
It will.    
I can see from here it will.    
    
I have crossed frozen fjords in Iceland,    
slept before the ice rivers of Irland...
This is Mercia.    
The weather of these lands
is as unpredictable    
as the Saxons who live on them.    
That does not change the nature of ice,
my queen.    
But it is, as she says, a risk.    
All is a risk.    
[Rognvaldr] Let me show you I am right.    
I will walk upon the ice
to measure its strength.    
You tested me once.    
I survived.    
Let me show you I can lead in battle.    
Gods offer you this, Sigtryggr.    
Do not slight them by refusing it.    
It is a risk.    
But we will at least test it.    
Once night falls, have him test the ice.    
[Uhtred] I will take word to the Danes.
We will find you there.    
Aethelhelm shall be found and tried
before Saxons and Danes.    
We can forge a new union with Daneland.    
For that, I am glad.    
I am sorry for Osferth,
even though I did not know him well.    
He was still your blood.    
You were his true brother.
Yes. And I will avenge him.    
[Aethelstan] Lord Aethelhelm.    
As requested, I've stationed men to patrol
the east and the west perimeters.    
With the lake at our backs and ample eyes
to the trees, our camp may rest soundly.    
Look, I wish to inspire my men,
maintain their spirits, but...    
I fear I'm falling short.    
On the contrary,
you are an inspiration to them.    
You are proving yourself a true leader.    
Any minute now he'll pull a miracle
out of his saintly arse.    
He is both righteous and pompous,
just like his father.    
[Bresal] I have news. The ladies Aelswith
and Aelfwynn have been spotted.    
They travel with a personal guard.    
[Aethelhelm] Where are they?
South of Buccstan.    
They were seen by Mercian monks.    
Silver is a god all men serve.    
[Aethelhelm] Well,
the ladies will have to be rescued.    
The princess is important to us.
Her safety is our greatest concern.    
We need to get rid of him.    
Accidents can happen.    
Even at night.    
    
[Aelswith] We are leaving for the nunnery
before the sun sets.    
The sooner we move on
from this place the better.    
Lady Aelswith.
[Aelswith] Eadith?    
[Eadith] I've come to warn you
and Lady Aelfwynn. You are in danger.    
A man is tracking you.    
A man who seeks to exchange news
of your whereabouts for coin.    
You are certain of this?    
I would not have journeyed
all this way if I was not.    
Come with me.    
We are leaving before the day is over.    
[Eadith] You cannot wait even that long.    
Go now. Whoever this man is,
you do not want to meet him.    
Then we must go where he will not find us.    
[Aelswith] In truth,
it should comfort Aelfwynn to see you.    
[Aelswith] Where is Lady Aelfwynn?    
How could you let her leave?
I did not know.    
[Eadith] She has fled.    
[Aelswith] She has taken her horse.    
[Stiorra] This assault makes me uneasy.    
Is it the assault that troubles you,
my love, or the one I chose to lead it?    
You're entrusting him with too much.    
He seeks atonement by facing danger,    
a danger that will be great, which is why...    
I need you to go straight to the safety of
the surrounding trees as soon as we cross.    
Your plan is a good one.
You placed your trust in it.    
[Rognvaldr] Brother.    
It is as we hoped.
We may have found a way across the ice.    
Then the gods have answered us.
Tell the men.    
We rise before dawn and we attack them
in their deepest sleep.    
When we cross over,
make for the high ground.    
Strike down those Saxons
as they try to flee.    
 Lord Uhtred!
[Uhtred] It is one of Edward's scouts.    
What news do you bring?    
 Lord Aethelhelm
is camped in a valley north of here,    
on the banks of a frozen lake.    
He has raised a vast army.
Edward is on the road behind us.    
Find him and tell him
where Aethelhelm is camped.    
We must get to the lake.    
 That way.    
    
[Sigtryggr] Let's go.    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
[Aethelstan]    
Help! Help!
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
[Aethelhelm] This cannot be.    
Forget them!    
Protect me at all costs!    
 Shield Wall!    
    
    
    
    
[Rognvaldr] Watch out, brother!    
    
[Uhtred] Dear god, we're too late.    
[Finan] We must find a way to stop this,
Lord.    
[Uhtred] Stiorra!
    
[Stiorra] You must help Sigtryggr.
No, I must stop him.    
Aethelhelm was the one responsible
for the massacre at Rumcofa.    
This is his camp. Edward is coming
with  ,    men to apprehend him.    
He sought to restore the peace,
but when he sees this...    
We must tell Sigtryggr.    
He has seen reason before.    
Stay here.    
Get Aethelstan to safety
and cut a path to Sigtryggr.    
It's the only way to stop this.    
And Aethelhelm is to be taken alive!    
    
    
    
[Uhtred] Aethelstan!    
[Uhtred] Aethelstan!    
    
    
Aethelhelm! Why do you not fight?    
    
    
    
Aethelstan!    
    
    
    
    
    
[Uhtred] Aethelstan!    
    
    
    
Sihtric, get him to safety!    
You find Sigtryggr,
I'll deal with Aethelhelm!    
    
    
[Edward] I rode for peace.    
And Sigtryggr has repaid us
with more bloodshed!    
Lord, what would you have us do?    
We must trust, Uhtred.
There is still time for him to stop this.    
    
[Uhtred] Sigtryggr!    
[Stiorra] Aethelstan.    
Where is my father?    
[Aethelstan]
He's still searching for Sigtryggr.    
    
[Uhtred] Stop fighting me!    
I don't want to kill you!
    
[Uhtred] Stop! Sigtryggr!    
[Aldhelm] Many more lives will be lost
if we do not act now.    
Those men, your men, they are
Christian souls, the future of England.    
That is what Aethelhelm wishes to destroy.    
Yes.    
Aethelhelm cannot be allowed to succeed.    
They must be saved.    
    
    
    
Edward is coming!    
    
    
Men! With me!    
Hold them!    
Men! With me!    
    
    
    
[Finan] Aethelhelm, I'm coming for you!    
You're a dead man!    
Fight me!    
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!    
[Aethelhelm] Get me away from here!    
[Finan] Fight me!
[Sihtric] Pull back!    
Too many protect him!    
    
    
    
    
Now surrender!    
    
    
    
Sigtryggr!    
    
[Sigtryggr] Get back!    
[Sigtryggr] Retreat! Get back!    
[Sigtryggr] Retreat! Fall back!    
    
Hold on!    
Sigtryggr!    
    
    
    
    
Rognvaldr! Rognvaldr!    
[Uhtred] Sigtryggr!
    
[Uhtred] Sigtryggr!
    
Stop! No more slaughter!    
[Uhtred] No more slaughter!
Put down your swords!    
    
Sigtryggr must not be harmed!
[Edward] Look around!    
Look at what his anger has wrought!
[Uhtred] Aethelhelm is to blame!    
Put down your swords!    
It is over!    
    
    
No, Stiorra!
Let me go!    
You cannot save them.    
    
It's done.    
[Stiorra] No.    
Stiorra!    
A king should always heed the good counsel
of his queen.    
I should not have forgotten this.
You have time to make it up to me still.    
Aethelhelm provoked this.
The massacre in Rumcofa was his doing.    
Edward was never your enemy.    
I was riding to tell you
he was calling for a truce.    
In the midst of battle,
Aethelhelm escaped.    
It is over for us, then.    
    
[Uhtred] No. It is not.    
Lord King.    
I've come to speak for Stiorra.    
She has killed no Saxons in this fight.    
Lord, I appeal to you as her father.    
Spare her.    
Then she is spared.    
You have my word.    
Thank you, Lord.    
Thank you.    
What of Sigtryggr?    
His fate is to be decided.    
Swear a new alliance with him.    
You would have me pardon a man who
slaughtered so many innocent Christians?    
You have won some favor
with the Lords here today.    
Do not risk it.
Favor is not only won with the sword.    
Your men know that you can fight.    
Show them that you also know mercy.    
Our people must be assured
of your leadership.    
[Uhtred] They are not the only ones, Lord.
The Danes are also your people now.    
You must unite them all,
ensure that this does not happen again.    
Do not despair.    
There is still much for our kin
to sing of.    
For many years there was peace
between Saxon and Dane...    
until one emerged who has sown hatred
between our God and yours.    
This battle shattered that peace.    
I have decided to restore it.    
I give you my word
as King of all the Saxons.    
In exchange...    
you must accept the gift of baptism.    
All shall be welcomed
into the family of Christ.    
Never again
will our people face such division.    
We will be united.    
You ask to strip them of their gods,
of who they are.    
It is too much.    
It is an offer of peace.    
A Dane stripped of his gods
is no longer a Dane.    
Your people will be safe,
but under the rule of a Christian king.    
[Rognvaldr] We must do it.    
It is over, brother.    
Stiorra was right.    
You are a coward.    
I will not swear.    
I cannot.    
So be it.    
It does not have to come to this.    
He has chosen, Uhtred,
and I cannot go back on my word.    
[Uhtred] He is not the one to blame.
Aethelhelm is responsible.    
And yet he has fled the battlefield.    
Aethelhelm worked
to destroy the peace you created.    
If Sigtryggr dies, he has won.    
Do not let him.    
    
What did the king say?    
You have been spared.    
But Edward is to be Overlord of Eoferwic.    
And Sigtryggr is sentenced to death.    
    
    
I am to die.    
I'm sorry.    
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.    
Do not be.    
I have failed.    
I let them take everything.    
You have not failed.    
I will take back Eoferwic.    
Danes will live there in peace
for countless generations.    
You must be the one to do it.    
Do not ask me to do this.
[Sigtryggr] Uhtred.    
I only wish for an honorable death...    
at the hands of a great warrior.    
I wish to the gods we were not here.    
Perhaps we would not be.    
You brought Edward here.    
If you had done nothing,
we would have won.    
They will cheer for you in Valhalla.    
And I will sing for you here on earth.    
I will wait for you
in the halls of our ancestors.    
Will you find me?    
They may butcher our bodies...    
our souls are Odin's own.    
    
We should stop to rest soon.
Wait.    
[Brida] Stand back.    
    
Do not be afraid.
We mean you no harm.    
[Brida] You're one of Sigtryggr's men.    
[Brida] Who did this?    
Saxons. They slaughtered us.    
 We fought only
to avenge our people.    
[Uhtred] Was Uhtred Ragnarson
at the battle? Uhtred Ragnarson?    
He fought with the Saxons.     
[Pyrlig] Brida.
You promised me a path to forgiveness.    
Is this the peace you speak of?    
What you have with Uhtred...
Is worse!    
The Danes lived with the Saxons
in harmony for years.    
Uhtred's daughter was their queen    
and yet they slaughtered them like dogs.
What will they do to me?    
The conflict between Edward and Sigtryggr
is entirely separate.    
Conflict?    
What conflict?
Did you know that this would happen?    
The scout mentioned
that Edward was riding north. That is all.    
You lied to me.
No.    
You used my grief for Vibeke to disarm me?    
No, that is not true...
You're leading me into a trap!    
I only sought to help you find redemption.    
Redemption?    
Peace?    
Mere words used to mask your true motives.    
There can be no reconciliation.    
    
You wish to help me, Father Pyrlig?
    
Then give Uhtred a message if you live.    
Tell him I'm coming for him.    
    
[Aethelstan] We should not
have left Rumcofa.    
Perhaps then Osferth may still be with us.    
I wish to go back to my old life, Uhtred.    
That time is over.    
Men look to you now as a leader.    
I wish they did not.    
[Edward] I wish
that this had not come to pass.    
Yet, there is hope,
even in all this despair.    
Eoferwic is yours, Lord King.    
The dream of England
has never been closer.    
I will ensure you're safe in Eoferwic.
How?    
[Stiorra] You have broken the spirits
of my kin. It is no longer a refuge.    
You still have family.    
I'm also your kin.    
We can build a new home.    
I knew love, Father.    
I left a queen and now I have nothing.    
Edward's victory has been my undoing.    
[Bresal] We can lie low here,
set out at first light.    
Find the nearest port town and bribe
our way in a ship bound for Frankia.    
I have no intention
of slinking off into the shadows.    
Lord, you have lost your army...    
your reputation with the king.    
My grandson now stands alone.    
Securing his legacy
has never been more urgent.    
What about you?
Complete the task I was set.    
I was sent to secure an alliance
with the King of Scotia.    
I intend to turn it to my advantage.    
Only Constantin of Scotia,
the true Christian king,    
has power to end Edward's tyranny.    
King Constantin will be expecting a gift.    
We shall give him one.    
[Aethelhelm]
The Lady Aelfwynn is without allies. 
You must retrieve her. 
The Northumbrians share much news,
Lord King.    
The Saxon Edward has routed Sigtryggr.    
Then we were wise to invite
the Northumbrians as our guests.    
Will we be executing any of them?    
We'll make one an example
and the other lords will swear.    
All stand for King Constantin of Scotland!    
Welcome, Lords of Northumbria...    
to this feast of friendship.    
Whilst our ale is strong and plentiful,
the day comes with sobering news.    
Edward turned on his greatest ealdormen
and he turned on his ally Sigtryggr.    
From this we assume
we must prepare for hostilities.    
We fear he will turn his gaze northward    
and add Northumbria and Alba
to his conquests.    
This is a moment to join as one    
and confront the threat
from over-mighty Wessex    
before our lands are swallowed
by this dream of England.    
What say you, Lord Edmund of Jarrow?
Aye.    
Aelfgar of Berwick?
I will swear also.    
What's your name?    
Wihtgar, my lord.    
Wihtgar of Bebbanburg.

SEASON: 05
EPISODE: 05
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[Uhtred] I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred. 
Aethelflaed, the Lady of Mercia,
has died and I am bereft. 
Aethelhelm has sought to install
his grandson, 
Aelfweard, on the Mercian throne. 
But Edward was ruthless... 
[Aethelhelm] Did you see the ealdormen?  
I did. They are dead.  
[Edward] I will do as God wills.  
I will be king of the Angles
and of the Saxons.   
[Uhtred] Aelswith,
fearing for her granddaughter's safety, 
took Aelfwynn and fled Mercia. 
The distraught Brida
has taken Father Pyrlig prisoner, 
but his kindness has eased her pain. 
[Pyrlig] Your daughter is at peace now.   
Maybe in finding peace of your own,
you might repent.   
[Uhtred] Aelflaed has become enthralled
by the visionary, Aalys. 
Travel with us and do not tell them.   
It is a holy tribute.   
[Uhtred] While her father Aethelhelm,
thwarted by Edward once again, 
must find new ways to exert his influence. 
This is not the way
succession is determined!   
[Uhtred] Destiny is all! 
[Mildrith] You murder!
You killed my husband!   
You killed our ealdormen!
Oi! Get back here!   
You killed them all!
Ignore threat. Maintain your dignity.   
Do not rise to provocation.   
What news do you bring?
Has Eoferwic located Pyrlig?   
No news of Father Pyrlig, Lord King.   
But I imagine Sigtryggr will be unsettled
by the news from here.   
Yes.   
Perhaps we should make overtures
to reassure them. Scotland too.   
Let King Constantin know
we are minded to renew the alliance.   
My Lord, I do not serve you.   
I am here only to say my farewells.   
Whilst I understand your reasons,
I cannot be a part of this.   
Oh, how virtuous.   
Aelfwynn would have presided
over a civil war.   
I loved my sister. I do not dishonor her.   
You simply do what is best for Mercia.   
[Edward]   
Should I have shown more mercy?   
Was there another path?   
A kingdom is never made without bloodshed.   
But it does not need to be ruled by fear.   
Show the world that you are just
and that you live by the faith.   
As a sign of our wish to atone   
and reconcile with the sons of Mercia,   
we offer our fast
until the masses are completed.   
[Edward] Accept these offerings
from our table.   
Feast here as our guests,
even as we refrain.   
It is my hope
we put this turbulence behind us.   
[Aelfweard] Do you think he's sincere?   
I can no longer read his mood.   
[Aelfweard] I feel just sickened
with it all.   
The brutality,
the way he dishonors Mother.   
[Aethelhelm] It's because
you are a fine and true young man   
who, one day, will be a mighty king.   
If this is so, then why...   
Why does he not name me the aetheling?   
Some men cannot think of their own demise.
It frightens them.   
But with your permission,
I will find a way to resolve this.   
I need to be certain
that nothing can be traced back to me.   
The men can bear none of my insignia.   
Yes, I understand and they will say
they are from King Sigtryggr.   
I know what I'm doing.   
You do realize this could start a war
between Christian and Dane?   
Hopefully, yes.   
[Aethelhelm] Ideally,
the King falls in battle   
and Aelfweard inherits a land
free of the heathen curse.   
Time is running out for my bloodline.   
[Bresal] Could you not wield influence
another way?   
Build a few minsters or declare a miracle?   
How charmingly old-fashioned, Bresal.   
No, like the King,   
I have learned nothing is
as effective as the stench of death.   
[Aalys] Do not worry.   
When we have delivered the tapestry,
you may return home from the Holy Isle.   
With God's speed, the King
may never learn that I have been away.   
The light is fading.
We shall be forced to sleep under trees.   
You must regret
traveling with simple folk.   
You are not simple folk.
You are a gift from the Lord.   
[Aelflaed] The life of a queen
can be somewhat lonely.   
 Please...   
Be careful.
It could be a trick for thieves.   
Stand back until they are gone.
Lady, please.   
 Have pity.
We must help this traveler, my lady.   
Do not be softhearted. Stay.   
He is a soul in need.   
What happened here with you...    
Which one of these
is the farm girl from Lewes?   
   
I am the visionary.   
A visionary,
but you did not see us coming.   
Whose men are you?   
We were sent by King Sigtryggr.   
[Sigtryggr] All of Mercia's ealdormen?
All of them?   
Slaughtered, yes.   
With his sister not yet cold.   
She must have restrained Edward
more than we knew.    
    
I fear we could be next,
that he will come to conquer.    
Take a band to the border
and double the patrol.    
Send a warning to the King himself.
Yes.    
Dispatch a warrior
to speak this in my name,    
"If he chooses to come north,
we will be ready."    
    
We are restored!    
Remove the Saxon sign!    
Burnstone.    
Very pretty.    
Someone will buy it.    
Lord Haesten, Lord Haesten!    
You must see this.    
    
    
    
    
 Jesus, please...    
Who did this?    
They were sent from the King of Jorvik.    
They said Sigtryggr wanted vengeance.    
They spared me to spread the word.    
Are you pilgrims?    
    
Travelers with the dead queen.    
    
    
Take the body down
and clear all traces of this.    
Now!    
    
    
How many return to us?    
How many?    
Warn the alehouse! Osferth's thirsty!
    
Aethelstan, go straight to the boatman.    
Get something fast.
We can sail at high tide.    
[Uhtred] You're still alive.    
Just.    
Just is enough.    
What of Stiorra and her husband?    
[Uhtred] They are restored    
just.    
But    
Lady Aethelflaed...    
She has been taken from us.    
That is a cruelty, Father.    
But she's at peace.    
It is of some comfort.    
There has been much cruelty.    
Have you...    
Um...    
Have you walked at all?
A little.    
    
Many things are difficult, but    
my body is strong.    
 And my heart...
Will be avenged.    
Brida lives.
We fear she has Father Pyrlig.    
At high tide, we take a boat to track her.    
With that you could come...
The Lord is not calling me to revenge.    
No.    
Of course.    
To kill her might be my destiny alone.    
Perhaps it's not your destiny.    
You have a good life here, Father.    
Now that Lady Aethelflaed is departed,    
you could find a wife,    
have more children.    
One son lost as a babe.    
One now lying injured.    
A daughter who fought alone for her life.    
I would not curse another child
with me as a father.    
What of the son who was hidden,
who does not know his father?    
You do not know that.    
It is not safe for you to know that.    
His time will come.    
Besides...    
Aethelflaed    
is not departed.    
She, uh...    
She's with me still.    
Then we both must walk
with wounds that will not heal.    
 Here. This way.    
We are not here to be seen.    
Where is our boat?    
Where is the sea?
There is no sea.    
Girl, you have no sense.
I have changed the plan.    
In here...
What is happening?    
Is someone planning on having me killed?
No, child.    
Someone is planning on giving you life.    
What?    
I will not have you living in the shadows,
waiting for some assassin.    
My mother bore that danger every day.    
Yes and living the way she did
put a poison in her flesh    
and robbed me of my most cherished gift.    
What is your plan for me?    
I have chosen you a husband.    
Someone you know.    
I will explain.    
I have been asked to convey a message
of great seriousness and secrecy.    
The Lady Aelswith has noted
your affection for her granddaughter    
and asks that you convey yourself
to Buccstan for Sunday.    
There you will meet
with Lady Aelfwynn and marry her.    
Why have I been selected
for this alliance?    
Because you're a nobody.    
[Aethelstan] If Aelfwynn marries you,
no ealdorman can force her hand.    
Then I will be honored
to preserve the safety of the princess.    
    
Osferth.    
The great warrior Haesten, a man of trade.    
I had heard of this,
but I did not believe it.    
A trader and owner of    ships.    
You should see my settlement, Uhtred.    
Twice the size of this one,
fertile farms and fat women.    
Not like this...    
only fit for...    
pigs.    
You have plenty of insults for a man
who can no longer wield a sword.    
I can wield it, Uhtred.    
I think you should go.    
No.    
We must speak, somewhere out of sight.    
There's nothing I want from you.
[Haesten] Believe me, Uhtred.    
We must speak.    
Where's this visionary now?    
I placed her with my kin.    
To trade her?    
To keep her safe.    
war will come from this.    
Why would Sigtryggr do
something so stupid?    
[Uhtred] He has not.    
It's not his command.    
His brother, then? Or Brida?    
[Osferth] Perhaps Mercians,
seeking revenge.    
There's quite a few who hate Edward now.    
This is a bad omen, Lord, for all of us.    
I fear this death
will only deliver more death.    
Why did you bring me this?    
We both have interest
in keeping the peace, Uhtred.    
Me to trade and you, well...     
I cannot think Edward will spare
your daughter when he retaliates.    
We must make Sigtryggr denounce this act.    
Finan, Osferth, remain here.    
You must guard
the Queen's body with all honor.    
Sihtric, Aethelstan,
go to Aegelesburg, both of you.    
If they hear of this,
come north to warn me.    
No, we cannot hide news
of the Queen's slaughter. It's wrong.    
She has a son who should know, a father.    
Aethelhelm will want revenge.
He will blame all Daneland for this.    
You will not have to hide it for long.    
I will be swift and then I will bring
the Queen's body to Aegelesburg myself.    
Haesten, come with me to Eoferwic.
Tell them what you've heard.    
Let me come to Eoferwic.
Aethelstan!    
Let him. I will have no part in this.
You are already a part of it. We all are.    
If they hear
this story of Sigtryggr killing a queen,    
there will be a slaughter
beyond Brida at her worst.    
Does that not get heavy?    
You do not have to hold your sword.    
[Brida] You're stronger than me.
The sword makes us equal.    
How far are we going?    
This is where the journey ends.    
Head south,
eventually you'll reach Winchester.    
Hear me on this.    
Edward does not want battle
with Daneland or with Danes.    
Come with me
to Winchester and seek a peace.    
They will execute me
before I'm within the gates.    
I will stand for you.
You will be under my protection.    
The war should end, Brida.    
The war you started    
and the war within you.    
Good luck with the wolves.    
    
[Brida] Father Pyrlig?    
I accept your offer
of safe passage and protection.    
Take me to Uhtred.    
But my offer was to Edward.
He is the king.    
But Uhtred is the enemy
with whom I must reconcile.    
If I am to come to peace, he's the one.    
What? I thought you believed
I was ready for redemption.    
We've had no word
of the Visionary's demise.    
Word of this should be spreading!    
The bodies will be found.
They were left hanging near an open road.    
If this has gone wrong...    
You'll do what?
Send an assassin to kill me?    
What's Aethelstan doing here?    
The King must've summoned him.    
Someone is ahead of me.
They're trying to make use of this moment.    
And the whereabouts of Lady Aelswith?
Still making inquiries.    
We must locate her and the Lady Aelfwynn
in case there is a plot forming.    
Do not start changing the plan.    
In a fight to the death,
a man must be nimble.    
I jump to escape being pushed.    
We will be noticed.    
Sihtric. We will be found.
Not if you stay quiet.    
Learn to move by stealth.    
Lord King, a moment?    
We are leaving
to visit some of my new estates.    
It cannot wait, Lord King.    
An atrocity has occurred
against the faith.    
[Bresal] Big ride for a small woman.    
It belongs to my husband.    
Traveling light?    
Empty-handed...    
I do not know who you are    
and I do not need your money.    
Did the family reward you, then?    
Show gratitude for all you did?    
Where are they,
Ladies Aelfwynn and Aelswith?    
Where have they gone?    
I do not owe you an answer.    
People are    
concerned for Lady Aelfwynn's safety.    
So, if you remember where they are...    
...find me.    
I want the horse I paid for. Go.
All right.    
I need to leave Aegelesburg tonight.
That man is looking for Aelfwynn.    
That one.    
[Aldhelm] That is not good.
Is he the King's man?    
[Eadith] I do not know.    
Do you know where they went?    
You do not have to tell me the place...
Yes, I do.    
I will travel there to warn them
that they are being tracked    
if you stay to keep one eye on the King.    
    
Little Aalys    
slaughtered as she carried the tapestry
on its sacred journey.    
Hung from a tree
like a piece of rotten meat.    
The visionary.    
A symbol of your common people, murder.    
Let us join together now    
to confront this Dane threat
before Sigtryggr    
and his brother unite to slaughter us all!    
[Edward] Where did you hear this news?    
You know I have friends in every town,
but I urge you, Lord King,    
you cannot delay a response.    
Fury must be met with fury.    
Or the common people
will act on your behalf.    
I would like to have this
properly confirmed.    
You choose now to act with caution?    
When you have shown such boldness of late?    
The pilgrims may be resting peacefully
in Lindisfarne as we speak.    
Or killers maraud your lands
without consequence...    
[Edward] Perhaps!    
But I will not be moved
to retaliate until I am certain.    
Is there truth in it?    
I can make inquiries.    
If he is correct,
it will indeed cause dismay.    
And great division
between Christian and Dane.    
I've observed
you have not yet left Mercia.    
I hope I have reassured you
I'm not wholly impulsive.    
I need men here I can trust.    
Stay here and watch Aethelhelm.    
If he has heard this much,
he's going to hear much worse.    
    
I am insulted.    
Let me assure you,
if I were attacking Wessex,    
I would do more than strangle a queen.    
To be fair, Uhtred said this.    
Who do you think is responsible?    
Who acts in your name?
No one.    
This is the work of Edward himself.    
He hated the Queen, and he hates us.    
He has killed her to justify a war.    
[Uhtred] He does not want a battle.    
But when he hears of this,
he will have to retaliate.    
Which is why we have sent men
to our border.    
I will go to him with your denial.    
Though were you to journey with me,
this matter could be settled easily.    
And leave Eoferwic undefended once again?    
I have given my word.    
That is enough.    
    
He suffers from his allies deserting him.    
I did not desert you.    
I have men this moment
preparing to track Brida...    
Yet we sit alone in Eoferwic.    
I'm trying to save you
from a battle you will not win!    
    
Edward has twice the sliver,
twice the armies.    
Now he has Mercia...    
I am not afraid of a man
who cannot even protect his own wife.    
Take me to the visionary.    
I must find out who spread these lies.    
    
 There's a rider!    
 Out of the way, men!    
What approaches?    
[Eadgifu] They say
a messenger from the Danes.    
What is the word of Sigtryggr?
 A declaration.    
"If King Edward chooses to come north,
we will be ready."    
Sigtryggr has, in essence, called for war.    
No, he has warned us not to approach.    
It is different.
I do not understand this reluctance.    
Aethelstan?    
Is Uhtred with you?    
No, he is visiting his daughter.    
Now your greatest warrior has abandoned
his post at Rumcofa to join Sigtryggr!    
[Aethelstan]
Lord Uhtred is a man of honor!    
He goes only to see his child,
so do not inflame the matter.    
Be wiser.    
Please, Lord Aethelhelm.    
Rather than press for battle,
I would ask you take a gift to the Scots.    
They will be nervous of trouble
on their border.    
Then, if that is your order,    
I shall gladly leave Aegelesburg.    
You speak your mind.    
I heard you were quite the fighter.    
I need a loyal man
to lead the Mercian Guard.    
Live here alongside them
and be my presence here in Aegelesburg.    
Perhaps that man could be you
in recompense for...    
My banishment?    
There are worse fates
than to be raised by Uhtred.    
It'll be a better use of your talent
than spying on your father.    
I should like to accept.    
Do you want my oath?    
[Edward] Do I need it?    
If I cannot trust my son, who can I trust?    
[Bresal] I'm not sure this is wise.    
If Edward cannot be provoked,
perhaps Sigtryggr can.    
He's clearly anticipating an attack,
so let's give the heathen what he wants.    
Come and meet my men.    
They are common folk.    
You'll like them.    
    
Ignore it. Go to sleep.    
I cannot.    
I have too much to consider.    
What day will he come for us?    
I have said Sunday.
So, now we must be patient.    
What is it like to be married?    
When one is married to the right person,    
it is the greatest gift
the Lord can bestow.    
The passions of the flesh    
when enacted within loving matrimony
are transporting.    
When one feels the tremors
of male affection...    
Grandmother.
It is but an honest answer.    
It is why Alfred and I
had such beautiful children.    
What if one is married
to the wrong person?    
I hardly know Cynlaef.    
I hardly knew Alfred.    
It is the way of things.    
With the wrong person    
I'm told marriage is a living hell.    
Nonetheless, the bond holds fast.    
[Aethelhelm] It grieves me to be
the bearer of such news.    
I know how much
the visionary meant to you all.    
And to think of that child strangled,    
defiled, her body hung from a tree!    
It's unbearable.    
My man Bresal here...    
informs me that
the Dane assassins who killed her    
now disguise themselves in godless Rumcofa    
among the heathen settlers there.    
I cannot be seen    
to go against my King's command.    
But if any of you wishes to avenge this,    
there will be warm fires
to welcome you in my camp.    
For too long we have let
the Dane threat live alongside us,    
welcomed them into our homes,
our food in their mouths    
while they plot bloody outrage!    
Any man who wishes
to avenge themselves is free to go    
to seek the justice your King should seek!    
Whose men are you?
We come from the King.    
Dane murder are hiding here
and you must hand them over.    
Of course, my men will attend to it.    
Bresal, no Dane here would kill
Queen Aelflaed. They are good people.    
Why do you speak of Queen Aelflaed?    
[Finan] Cynlaef!    
Get your arse out here!    
No Cynlaef?
No, why?    
What's wrong?    
I need someone to alert the men downriver.    
But quietly, so it doesn't look like
we want a fight. Soldiers have arrived.    
They say they're from Edward,
but I'm not sure I believe it.    
I'll go.
No!    
I can raise the men of Rumcofa.    
They know me,
and no one will notice me leave.    
    
Do that.    
Send them up and wait downriver
until I say it's safe to return here.    
Swear it.    
I swear. Go.    
    
What are you doing?
These are innocent folk!    
Get your hands off her!    
[Osferth] Tell your men to stand down!    
[Osferth] Who are you?    
Finan! These men have been here before!    
Danes of Rumcofa have murder our Queen!    
 Queen killers!
Dane-loving scum!    
Do your duty
and rid the cockles from the wheat!    
Stop it!    
Danes here! Christian there!    
Separate them.    
[Bresal] Dane! Saxon!    
Danes in here, go! Come on!    
Father, declare a sanctuary! Go!    
You'll be safe in here.    
Bresal, they are good people...    
    
 Get off me!    
    
    
    
    
Osferth, Cynlaef! This way!
We must get Ingrith!    
Check the docks!    
Come with me!    
[Finan] Ingrith!    
[Ingrith] Get out of my way!    
Ingrith!    
Ingrith, go!
Come on!    
[Bresal] Fight me, boy!    
    
    
[Finan] Ingrith!    
    
Ingrith!    
    
    
    
    
[Cynlaef] No!
[Finan] No!    
    
You're all right!
You're all right. Hey, hey!    
    
It's all right.    
Help!
[Osferth] Where's the wound?    
Where is it?
    
Oh, my God, I'm going to die!    
    
It's all right.
    
Don't let me die, Finan!    
 Shh, I'm here with you.
    
    
    
[Haesten] Do not be afraid, Aalys.    
Uhtred is no danger.    
He seeks only to make this right.    
I swear I mean you no harm.
I come only to hear your story.    
The men that attacked the Queen...    
they claimed to come from Sigtryggr, yes?    
How did they know where to find her?    
We told no one the Queen rode with us.    
Her menfolk would have forbidden it.    
Did they say why they wanted the Queen?    
They did not want her.    
They came for me.    
They did. They spoke my name.    
But the Lord guided her.    
She stood for me,
claimed my place in the slaughter.    
I wanted only to see the Holy Isle.    
Why did St. Cuthbert lead me...    
...then let this happen?    
I've got him.    
 I'm sorry.    
    
It's my fault!    
It's all my fault.    
    
Pater noster qui es in caelis... 
Do not do that.    
Danes, they have other customs.    
Take the survivors to Danelaw.    
Mercia is no place for us.    
    
We will take Osferth back
to the place of his birth.    
Let him rest in Wessex.    
Take Finan with you to meet Uhtred.    
    
I will meet Sihtric
on the road to Aegelesburg.    
Take Aalys to Lindisfarne.
I have a friend there who will hide her.    
killing a Queen, I follow.
But who would want to kill a farm girl?    
Someone who wishes to stir the people.    
Brida?    
It is too sly for her.    
Whichever, I ride to tell the King.    
He can perhaps be restrained
if he knows his wife was not the prey.    
This is slightly
on the light side, Uhtred.    
I should be properly compensated
for the hospitality I have shown the girl.    
You were compensated    
by whatever you stole from the dead Queen.    
    
People do not entirely change, Haesten.    
 Let them through!    
 News from Rumcofa!    
 Fetch the guard!
This way?    
[Aethelstan] Lord Aelfweard.    
I'm Aethelstan...
I know who you are.    
I cannot forget the boy held hostage
with me in Winchester    
who offered the Danes his life for mine.    
There is talk of an uprising in Rumcofa.    
People there found
the men that slew the visionary.    
You need to go inside immediately.    
And you need to fetch the King... now.    
    
We were close in spirit once.    
When she was first brought
to the palace, I felt...    
    
...I had found...    
not a beloved but at least a friend.    
Someone should tell her father.    
That falls to me, as penance
for ignoring his warnings about the Danes.    
    
Have him brought
from the road to Scotland.    
She was dishonored in life,
so she will be honored in death.    
We must ready both armies
to extract justice from Sigtryggr.    
His wife... for mine.    
    
[Eadgifu] I have been told the news.    
It is...    
...beyond words.    
I did not know her well...    
But you humped her husband nonetheless...    
ignored the bonds of matrimony,    
gave your flesh freely
and brought the wrath of God.    
[Eadgifu] Lord...    
that is your own guilt speaking.    
Do not seek to place this on me
for I am blameless...    
We are not blameless!    
How can this be anything
other than judgment?    
My God is not vengeful
and neither should you be.    
This is the work of men, not God.    
Find the men that wronged her
and have them feel your wrath.    
Forgive me.    
    
I'm not myself.    
In truth, I feel a burning shame.
I did not love her as I vowed to.    
I am not... I am not a good man.    
    
You are a good man.    
It matters not you did not love her.    
Others did. That is enough.    
Tell the boy the dreadful news.    
    
[Eadgifu] Pity him. 
Do not pity yourself.    
    
    
Think of no one but me.    
Look at nothing but my eyes.    
    
Feel nothing but my body.    
    
    
Swear to me this will not destroy you.    
Be a good king, not a good man.    
[Benedict] Men, women and children
herded into my church and slaughtered.    
Farm boys wrenched
from their loving mothers.    
All unprovoked,
all taken when they had no sword.    
What reason did they give
for the King's wrath?    
They claimed it was revenge
for the death of the Queen.    
Their reason is to cleanse
all Danes from Saxon lands.    
Although they have lived alongside them
for many years,    
they do not want them there.    
Your new King and Queen will protect you.    
You are no longer people of Mercia
but live under the shield of Eoferwic.    
Christians will not harm you here.    
Ordinary Christians do not hate Danes.    
And yet Edward
will no longer let us thrive here!    
    
We will avenge you.    
We will avenge you.    
 We have to go to war.    
We will go north and confront Sigtryggr.    
Send word he will pay in blood
for this affront to us all.    
You fight under one king
for the first time.    
No longer men of Wessex or Mercia...    
but Saxons all.    
    
Come.    
Take some guards to find Lord Aethelhelm.
Bring him home to us, child.    
    
Sihtric... tell me.    
News is being spread in Aegelesburg    
with talk of confronting
the Danes in battle.    
How did the news come?
Lord Aethelhelm.    
He spoke of the dead visionary
and pressed for vengeance    
but did not speak of the Queen.
    
He did not know. She journeyed in secret.    
    
What if he planned it?    
The killing...
What? Of his own daughter?    
No, of Aalys.    
Aethelhelm was unaware
his daughter traveled with the pilgrims.    
So he arranged to kill the visionary
to poison the people against the Danes.    
Then I almost pity him.    
Do not pity him.    
What he has unleashed
will throw my daughter against the Saxons.    
We must alert Edward to the enemy within.
[Cynlaef] Lord!    
[Uhtred] What are you doing here?    
Aelfwynn is in Buccstan.    
    
What news of Rumcofa?    
What of my son?
My family?    
Your son lives, Lord.    
Your wife and children too, but...    
many in Rumcofa...    
Where is Osferth?    
Finan, where is Osferth?
[Uhtred] Finan!    
Tell us. Where is Osferth?    
Make way for the King!    
Sigtryggr, let me lead a warrior band.    
Let me do
more than buttress a shield wall.    
Let him join the vanguard. Walk out front.    
    
If you ask me to, I will turn back now.    
I will not ask.    
If the King seeks to threat us,
we retaliate...    
even if it means fighting
against those that I love.    
I never wanted to rend you
from your family.    
I held the peace
so I may hold you, unfractured.    
I am not fractured.    
And we are united.    
    
    
    
We leave to join our men
on the border without delay.    
We summon the Saxon king!    
And in three days...  in three days,    
 our army will destroy
Edward's army upon the high hills.    
 Yes.    
In three days, we slaughter him,
his offspring    
and those who fight in his name.    
Tell the coward boy the battle place.    
Tell him Sigtryggr will be waiting.    
 Sigtryggr!    
Lord Aethelhelm.    
We have scattered many men
in search of you.    
And you're the one to find gold.    
I've been asked to bring you back
to Aegelesburg.    
Why?    
I do not know the reason, Lord.    
Please just return with me.    
Not today.    
Feed him.    
Make him welcome.    
This way, Lord Aethelstan.    
The little bastard knows something
he will not tell me.    
Perhaps you'd like to get it out of him.    
Come, see the men we have gathered
for this adventure.    
The King will need...
Lord, I must speak.    
The bastard may be concealing
that which I myself learned in Rumcofa.    
Your daughter was traveling
with the pilgrims    
and was also slaughtered.    
    
[Bresal] Lord.    
Did you hear that?    
I saw her body in Rumcofa, Lord.    
It's been taken to her husband.    
Forgive me, had we any idea...    
Lord, it's not my fault.    
Had you have said...    
I think it is quite clear
where the blame lies.    
    
[Bresal] Lord, put down the knife.    
No.    
It is the honorable way.    
Since when have we done
the honorable thing, Lord?    
Your grandson needs you alive.    
My grandson's fortunes are ruined.    
Without the Queen...    
    
...our influence dies.    
[Bresal] Then make them rise again.    
Finish what you've started.    
    
I know you can do this, Lord. I know it.    
Find yourself.    
Find it.    
Fight.    
    
    
    
    
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SEASON: 05
EPISODE: 04
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[Uhtred] I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred. 
After the shocking death of her daughter... 
I will catch you!
[Uhtred] No!  
...Brida fled Eoferwic in defeat. 
Retreat!  
  
[Uhtred] Aethelstan yearns to know
his true father, the King of Wessex, 
but Edward's attention turns towards
his new love, the Lady Eadgifu. 
For all its strangeness,
I did find our time together enjoyable.   
[Uhtred] And Aelflaed,
the Queen he no longer loves, 
looks to Christ to salve her humiliation. 
God knows your heart.   
I will pray for you.   
[Uhtred] My beloved Aethelflaed is dying. 
[Finan] She will not see the spring.
You must be mistaken in this, Finan.   
She does not have long.   
[Uhtred] She has chosen Aelfwynn
to succeed her. 
Knowing my daughter will be Lady of Mercia
in my stead, it is all I wish.   
[Uhtred] But as ever in Mercia,
the succession is not straightforward. 
The young Lady Aelfwynn
is not fit to rule.   
Does your master propose an alternative?   
He does indeed, Lord Burgred.   
[Uhtred] Now I ride to be with my love. 
I pray that I reach her
before it is too late. 
Destiny is all! 
   
   
   
   
 One!   
 Two!   
 He will not survive.
This is not about survival.   
It is about pain.   
 Three!   
[Wolland] An agony of burning
that the flesh never forgets.   
Then we wait to see if the blood sickens.
 Four!   
   
   
 Five!   
 Six!
   
   
   
   
   
 Seven!   
 Eight!   
   
   
 Nine!   
   
   
   
   
If the gods have not healed you
by the third sunrise,   
they have abandoned you to die.   
As will I.   
   
   
[Sihtric] Go, Lord.   
Where is she?   
I was wondering when you might grace us.   
You're not resting?   
She's the Lady of Mercia.
She can do as she chooses.   
As she has repeatedly reminded me.   
   
[Eadith] I have told her that she is sick.   
As I have told you
that I do not wish to lie still.   
There will be time enough for that.   
There, I am ready.   
[Aethelflaed] Will you escort me?
To go where?   
I have some obligations I must attend to.   
Let us go.   
You knew she was sick
and you did not tell me?   
She asked for my help and my silence.
I gave her both.   
She is dying, Uhtred.   
I have seen this before in those
whose time is close.   
They feel suddenly alive before...   
But do not be fooled,
she has little time left.   
Your nailed god cheated death, yes?   
After three days
suffering all the torments of hell.   
[Brida] You believe that He will raise you
from the dead on the day of judgement?   
It is a tenet of our faith, yes.   
He was your god as well, Brida.   
Do not forget where your life began
with Him, not the Danes.   
You are His child, just like we all are...
Tell me then, why did He abandon me?   
 Why?   
If Vibeke was His child,
why did He let her die? Why?   
   
Will He protect you, Father, hm?
Will He save you in this moment? Tell me.   
If He has decided
that this is my time, then so be it.   
Do not be so eager to believe that He has
any control over how your life ends.   
This will not be quick.
This is just beginning.   
   
Help him! Help!   
Where is He, Father? Is He coming?
Is He on his way?   
[Brida] Help him! [cackles madly]   
[Aelfwynn] It is strange
to see it so empty.   
[Aldhelm] It is not empty.   
Not yet.    
No. Not yet.    
You will not have to do this alone.    
I will remain with you.
And I am so grateful for that.    
I only hope that I might find her strength
when the time comes.    
I have served your mother for many years.    
You are her daughter.
I can see much of her in you.    
[Aethelflaed] I always thought
that rule would mean conflict, 
but the truth is
the people simply want peace.    
If they are well fed, if they have homes,
if they are warm,    
then they will soon come to respect you.    
Where are we going?    
I have some business with one
of the Ealdormen that I must attend to.    
Surely this is not the time?
Oh, so do tell me, what time is it?    
It is time to fight
what is happening to you.    
Do not be naive, Uhtred.
The battle is done.    
Why are you giving up so easily?
I am not giving up!    
I did not choose this.
This is the path that God has given to me.    
    
My Lady.
[Aethelflaed] Ealdorman Burgred.    
I have completed the letter
that we spoke of.    
This... this is too much.
It is barely enough.    
Mercia needs to be protected and I am sure
you will do what needs to be done.    
My Lady, you have been good to us.    
Just and fair.    
I remember when he was terrified
at the thought of you on the throne.    
People change, given time.    
What did you give him?    
I have land in my name that I wanted
to give to the people to ensure    
that it remains theirs when I am gone.    
And who will take the throne?
Aelfwynn.    
She is not the girl you once knew.
She understands her duty.    
If Edward and I can maintain our alliance
through our successors    
and they in theirs, our peace and unity
could last for generations.    
Aldhelm will remain with her to guide her
and she will have an army for protection.    
I do not wish to ask more favors of you.    
Aethelflaed.
Please.    
Let me speak.    
I would feel happier to leave her
if I knew    
that you would ensure her safety.    
You do not even have to ask.
I do.    
Your life is not here with me.    
Aelfwynn is not your kin.    
I did not help you when you came to me...
[Uhtred] Stop.    
I will protect Aelfwynn and Mercia
as best I can.    
Come. Let us find somewhere quiet to sit
or some may think I am breaking my oath.    
The gate is this way.    
There are other gates, ones that are not
so fiercely guarded.    
So, all these years I could have been
sneaking in here to hump you?    
I should send word
to my husband that it is finished.    
That he might ride to Lindisfarne
and see it.    
I am sure that both the Lord our God
and the King    
will be impressed with your tribute.    
You awake early, do you not?    
I pray every day to our Lord God
in the light of a new dawning sun.    
The King departed this morning.    
Did you happen to witness it?    
Did anybody accompany him?    
I think perhaps
the Lady Eadgifu rode with him.    
Come with us to Lindisfarne.    
The King has warned me
that my presence there    
could be seen as a claim
to the land itself    
and my father would surely take his side.    
No, I should remain here.    
Travel with us and do not tell them.    
It is not provocation.    
It is a holy tribute.    
Nothing is more pure.    
[Aelflaed] I should like to witness
its glory myself.    
[Aalys] As I am certain,
the King would also witness yours.    
    
[Brida] Do you wish a chance to pray?    
What prayer would you have me make?    
I don't know. What prayer would be best
to beg your god for your life?    
My life is in your hands, not His.    
Think that there is somewhere after this?    
I think that we will join Him
in life everlasting.    
Your god came back to life
while my daughter is cold.    
She will live with Him in eternal life.    
Tell Him to give her back.    
Give her back?
That is not something that my god does.    
A life for a life, then.    
Orvar! Orvar, will you give yourself
to me for Vibeke?    
No, there is no trading lives!    
Consider it a threat. Return her to me,
or this one's death will be on your hands.    
I cannot do that.
[Brida] But your god can.    
You're His voice! So speak! Give her back!    
[Brida] Give her back!
Dear God, spare her!    
Put no more blood on her hands!    
[Pyrlig] She was born your servant.
She need not die in torment.    
She can still repent
and join her daughter in paradise.    
    
    
My daughter's dead.    
My daughter's dead. I'm lost.    
We're never truly lost.    
God will find you.
You were born a Christian.    
He has seen the good that was passed on
through you to your daughter's heart.    
[Brida] Your god did not save Vibeke,
He let her die.    
There is no life after this for her.    
She's alone.    
    
 She's alone.    
 I am alone!    
    
No, you are not.    
    
Perhaps we should rest here.
For a short while.    
Is it cold? I feel so cold.    
    
It is cold enough.    
    
You should have told me.    
I did not owe you a share of my pain.    
I have not stopped wondering...    
about what we gave up...    
to become who we are.    
[Uhtred] Do you regret it?    
[Aethelflaed] On occasion.    
Then when I do,
it is with every part of my being.    
[Aethelflaed] What of you?    
Would you have begged fate
for a different path over these years?    
Mercia's people are contented.
They're safe.    
How could I deny them all you have done?    
That does not answer my question.    
I have dreamed of us.    
As a family.    
And a happy one.    
But even through that happiness,
even in my dreams...    
we never cease worrying
that we have made the wrong choice.    
[Uhtred] That's the curse of life,
to think of what might have been.    
Your path was to bring peace to Mercia,
to protect it.    
Who will protect you,
Uhtred of Bebbanburg?    
I do not need protection.    
You do.    
You do.    
You are carrying so much pain.    
I would have told you...    
My daughter committed
the greatest of all your god's sins.    
[Brida] If He does exist,
she will have been sent to the flames.    
[Pyrlig] That part of the Holy Book
has never much felt true to me.    
It seems to me there's not much separating
Heaven and Valhalla.    
That if we are right in our beliefs,
there is something better after this.    
No, your daughter had no chance to sin.
She made others kill for her.    
That's the same as if the knife
was in her hand.    
[Pyrlig] And as our parents teach us,
she was trying to please you. That is all.    
It is not her sin to repent for.    
It's not too late to believe in Him,
Brida.    
It is never too late.    
Believing in your god made the Danes weak.    
They lost their souls.
My daughter lost her life.    
I blame you.    
[Brida] I blame your church,
your kings and your queens.    
And most of all, I blame
every so-called Dane who bowed to them    
and sucked at their teats
and who took their baptism rites.    
You should eat.    
I cannot help to end your pain.    
Nothing can.    
But your daughter is at peace now.    
Maybe in finding peace of your own,
you might repent.    
[Brida] I don't want your bread.    
I believe it was your bread to begin with.    
[Pyrlig] Should you change your mind.    
    
[Sigtryggr] There is no honor
in him freezing to death.    
There is no honor in what he did to us    
and yet you would forgive him.
The gods have forgiven him.    
He passed their trial.
He must be in their favor.    
[Stiorra] If his flesh begins to heal,    
then we can talk about
allowing him back into the city.    
Listen to me! He is my brother!
And I am your wife!    
His fate is set.
It's in the hands of the gods now.    
He will die or he will survive.    
We will not know
until his hands are unbound.    
Here you go.
[Sihtric] Thank you.    
    
What was that?    
[Finan] King's men.    
When was the last time
you saw your father?    
A long time ago.    
Well, you'll be a fair bit taller
than him now, I'll bet.    
    
Uncle?
Aelfwynn.    
[Edward] Am I too late? Where is she?
She... She's not here.    
[Edward] Where is she?
[Aelfwynn] She is with Uhtred.    
Of course.
She wanted to see him before...    
I do not understand
why she is being taken from us now.    
Time robs us, over and over again.    
Your mother is the best of us.    
If I could keep her here,
you know I would.    
I know.    
The... the Ealdormen have been told
to prepare.    
I'm concerned that they will not honor
Mother's wishes.    
The Ealdormen will be taken care of.
Do not fear.    
[Edward] Your mother and I had
a shared wish...    
to honor our father's desire for unity.    
I swear to you and to her...    
I will do all I can to ensure
that comes to pass.    
[Aelswith] Please, let my Lord King
listen to the words of this servant.    
Please, let my Lord listen to the words
of this servant.    
    
[Edward] I did not get to speak with you...    
I love you.    
[Edward] I will protect all that we have
achieved, sister.    
This I swear to you.    
    
Receive your servant Vibeke    
into the ranks of your devout saints
and most bright angels.    
She is a child of God.    
[Aelswith] Please let my Lord listen
to the words of this servant...    
[Uhtred] Lady Aelswith...    
[Aelswith] You do not need to say
anything, Lord Uhtred.    
I would ask you...    
Do you hear anything?    
[Uhtred] Erm...    
[Uhtred] It is night. The town is asleep.    
[Aelswith] Not out there.    
In here. In this room.    
Do you hear anything?    
[Uhtred] No, nothing but our own voices.    
Mere mortals.
I do not care for our voices.    
He is not speaking.    
I thought that He would speak to me now.    
Is it not clear that I need Him?    
All I have ever asked of Him...    
is His voice when I needed it.    
Perhaps His silence
is Him offering you solace in...    
I do not need His solace.    
I need Him to speak to me.    
[Aelswith] My life, I have given to Him.    
I have prayed for so many hours,
Lord Uhtred.    
[Aelswith] I have begged Him to save her.    
I need to know that He is listening.    
    
I fear your prayers have been wasted.    
Please, let my Lord the King
listen to the words of His servant.    
Please, let my Lord
listen to the words of...    
Lady Aelswith...
I am trying to make Him hear me!    
    
Do not say it.    
Do not say the words.    
    
[Aelswith] He has forsaken me.    
He has forsaken her.    
I have given Him the entirety of my life.    
And I am left with nothing.    
    
    
    
Where is Aelfwynn?    
    
[Uhtred] She is waiting for the Witan.    
They will take advantage of her.    
They respected Aethelflaed. Surely
they will accept her choice of successor.    
Aelfwynn is too young
and she is not worldly.    
They will turn on her.    
She can gain their respect
just as Aethelflaed did.    
As wise as she had become...    
Aethelflaed still wished to believe
the best in people.    
But she was wrong.    
There has already been so much death,
Uhtred.    
I could not bear more of it.    
[Finan] I've had too much... oh...    
[Finan] Leave me here.
[Sihtric] You're all right.    
[Finan] Oh, God.
[Sihtric] Come on. Up the stairs.    
    
[Edward] Are the men ready?
 They're waiting for your signal.    
[Edward] And is there word
from Father Pyrlig?    
A scout reported seeing him
with the Danish witch.    
[Edward] Then he is likely dead.    
[Edward] Return to your position.
It will not be long.    
Aethelstan?    
What are you...?    
You came with Uhtred.    
He wanted the chance to say goodbye
to Lady Aethelflaed.    
A chance that his presence here denied me.    
Well, it seems he's taken many things
from you over time.    
I have often wondered of you.    
Surely I would not have been hard to find.    
We have found each other now, it seems.    
There are matters to be attended to. We...    
I should like to talk further with you.    
[Edward] Much has changed in both of
our lives, but now is not the time.    
It is good to see you, Aethelstan.    
You were much favored by my mother.
She would have been glad to have you here.    
[Aldhelm] You look like her.    
Have the Ealdormen been told?    
We will ring the bells when it is time
for the Witan to meet.    
They'll be terrified to leave Mercia
without a ruler    
for even a moment's breath.    
The Ealdormen respected your mother.
They will similarly respect her wishes.    
And Lord Aethelhelm has arrived.    
As much as his intentions
will be self-serving,    
his presence might help to delay matters.    
My mother has been dead a matter of hours
and already he seeks to undermine her.    
No, she would not have delayed it
and neither will I.    
You are in mourning.
You would be forgiven...    
My mother would not forgive me.    
I will not deny this land or its people
what she wanted for them.    
[Uhtred] I should have been here sooner.    
[Eadith] What matters is that you were
here for her when she needed you to be.    
Will you be remaining here?    
Until Aelfwynn takes the throne.
Should her grandmother allow it.    
Lady Aelswith is afraid
it is the wrong decision.    
Bitter old women rarely want more
for their descendants.    
She might be right.    
Why do we attach ourselves
to these people, Uhtred?    
I do not think it is our choice.    
Because it is our destiny?    
Then destiny is cruel.    
All it seems to do is cause us
sorrow and pain.    
If that is the path it sees for us.    
I wonder if destiny lost its hold on me
when I left these lands.    
I have been free of pain for a while now
and better for it.    
Perhaps pain is our choice, not destiny's.    
So tell me, Uhtred.    
What would finally allow you
to be free of your pain?    
    
[Eadith] What are they speaking of?
I do not know.    
[Uhtred] But I'm sure no good
can come of it.    
We should head back to the palace.    
[Edward] You served her well.    
I tried. All she wanted
was to keep the people safe.    
She could think of no way
to make it more simple to rule?    
She tried.    
But the Ealdormen, even as they came
to respect her, were stubborn.    
The old ways appealed to them
more than the new.    
I think you could yet be of great use
to Mercia, Lord Aldhelm.    
You do not have to be here this early.    
We've not yet begun.
Yes, I do.    
[Aethelhelm] Stay yourself!    
The throne is taken after the Witan meets,
not before.    
I did not expect to see you here.    
[Aethelhelm] I am here to show respect.
Oh, I doubt that.    
A man who has no respect
cannot show it, surely. Lord King.    
[Aethelhelm] This is taking too long.    
We must announce her death.
I would think it were the King's decision    
as to when the bells should be rung,
my Lord.    
I was merely suggesting...
That you understood the King's grief    
better than he himself?
Who are you to speak to me this way?    
You would watch your tongue!    
The bells will ring in good time.    
It is nearly dawn. Let us see the day
in with the saddest news.    
    
[Sihtric] Shut that door!
My balls are freezing to nothing!    
Something's wrong.
 Just go back to bed.    
[Osferth] Get some sleep. Lord Uhtred
might need us in the morning.    
[Aethelstan] There, did you see that?
Wake up.    
[Sihtric] No, no, it's the ale.
Your eyes are playing tricks on you. Just...    
    
    
Think about where you're pointing that.
[Aethelstan] There are soldiers here.    
You think it's an attack?    
The King is here and undefended.    
 Piss.    
Go and find Uhtred. I'll get the others.    
Do not do anything stupid.    
Do you hear me?
[Aethelstan] Yeah.    
It is time.    
Ring the bell.
Let my sister's death be known.    
You seem troubled.    
I don't like black. It's so cold.    
It would be a strange man who does.    
    
It is time.    
She asked that you protect Mercia.    
You have only done
as you saw right and good.    
Perhaps.    
    
[Sihtric] Aethelstan!    
Shit!    
    
    
    
Uhtred!
    
[Aethelstan] Uhtred!    
[Aethelstan] Uhtred!    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
 Leave him.    
[Uhtred] What happened? Are you all right?    
Lord, I think you need to see this.    
[Sihtric] Who are they?
The Ealdormen.    
[Sihtric] Come!    
Who gave your orders?
[Sihtric] Come on. Tell us!    
Uhtred, I know him.    
[Aethelstan] I saw him talking
with the King last night.    
    
[Aethelhelm] Did you see them?    
Did you see the Ealdormen?
[Uhtred] I did.    
So, where are they?
They are dead.    
[Aethelhelm] dead? That cannot be.    
You... What did you do?    
You overstep your bounds, Lord Aethelhelm!    
[Edward] The only explanation I need offer
is the example of our past.    
The strength of Wessex and Mercia
both only improved    
under the alliance with my sister.    
I could not see that strength fade now.    
Lady Aethelflaed's choice of successor
is her daughter.    
She has her mother's strength.
I have not seen it.    
[Edward] My sister's strength came
with time.    
[Edward] To leave my niece
to find her own strength    
would leave Mercia vulnerable.
She will not take the throne.    
Then there are others who could rule
whilst staying within the family's line.    
Father's hopes were of unity.    
It was a dream my sister and I bore
from him and shared, but now she is dead.    
Had she known it were possible
to unite the kingdoms...    
She would not have done it with the blood
of innocents on her hands!    
Her hands are unsullied. The choice
was mine alone and I was forced to act.    
The Ealdormen had already accepted bribes    
to sway their minds away
from my sister's wishes.    
[Edward] These men were standing
in the way of progress.    
I merely acted to remove the corruption.
This is not how succession is determined!    
Until my sister's rule, succession
was always determined by bloodshed.    
I did not want it to be so again.    
Better the blood of the few,
than the blood of the many.    
[Aldhelm] You have murder
Mercia's Ealdormen.    
And in doing so,
I have ensured Mercia's protection.    
I will do as God wills.    
I will be King of the Angles
and of the Saxons.    
[Sigtryggr] You are still alive, then?    
[Rognvaldr] That's because of you.    
[Rognvaldr] Will you look?    
    
    
The flesh has begun to heal.    
    
The gods have forgiven you.    
What of you, brother?    
Have you forgiven me?    
If it were Stiorra's choice,
you would be left to fend for yourself.    
Then I am lucky that it is not.    
She is not a true Dane.    
A true Dane would not betray
their family as you did.    
You are my blood.    
Do you understand? You are my blood.    
The rest will come in time.    
    
Have you seen Lady Aelswith?
Yes, she came through here with Aelfwynn.    
They left for...
Don't say it out loud.    
You should leave this place.
It is not safe here.    
Ah, it's just a scratch. It'll heal.
You might get a good scar out of it.    
It did not bleed like a scratch.    
[Finan] All right lads, at the ready.    
My men are merely seeking their horses.
There's to be no trouble here.    
You killed the Ealdormen.    
It is only what needed to be done.
[Aethelstan] They were old men.    
Defenseless.    
Uhtred has taught you
his strong sense of morality, then.    
Surely he has also taught
it is better to strike first    
if it might prevent more violence.    
[Edward] Yet it was not my intention
for you to be caught in this.    
My man tells me you fought well.    
Not well enough,
or he would not be here to tell you of it.    
Your blood is strong.
My skill comes only from my training.    
I must ready myself for the ceremony.    
Will you attend?    
I will be with Uhtred.    
Well, you'd be welcome
should you change your mind.    
Aethelflaed was your blood... as am I.    
[Brida] It's done.    
She gave me peace.    
When I was with her, I felt it.    
I'm sure she would want you
to find that feeling again.    
I can think of no better tribute.    
    
[Aethelstan] It looks to be
a worthy procession.    
[Uhtred] It is.    
Are you going to retaliate?
[Uhtred] He did what kings always do.    
No king has ever ruled bloodlessly.
It is not in their nature.    
It is no way to become a king, Uhtred.    
I think it might be the only way.    
It is over now.    
Edward's rule will not be challenged.    
His line will watch the throne
until it becomes their turn...    
just as King Alfred wanted.

SEASON: 05
EPISODE: 03
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[Uhtred] I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred. 
Rognvaldr has betrayed his brother
and helped Brida to invade Eoferwic. 
Do not be afraid, brother,
she's here to save us.  
[Uhtred] Whilst Brida has set Sigtryggr
a task he dare not refuse. 
We will find your wife, you know we will.  
I will spare her life
if you bring me Uhtred.  
[Uhtred] Eadith has delivered
the gravest news. 
Lady, I fear it is too late
to save you from this canker.  
I believe you will not see the spring.   
[Uhtred] In Winchester,
King Edward has found a new love. 
Lady Eadgifu, eat with us.   
Lord King, I would be honored.   
[Uhtred] But Aethelhelm continues
to plot against him. 
Inform the Saxon boroughs
not to give troops to assist him.   
This is the word of the king, is it?   
If asked, he will deny it.   
Stiorra cannot stand by
and let her people be murder. 
 Brida! You will pay for this!   
Then show yourself!   
[Uhtred] We must now enter the city
by stealth and save my daughter. 
Destiny is all! 
   
Brida!   
Stiorra!   
[Wolland] Stiorra, do not do this!
Do not cross her!   
See how the gods favor us, my Beloveds?
   
[Brida] See who they bring us?   
The gods will not forget
what you've done in their name.   
Hold your tongue,
or my men will cut it out for you.   
No. You will fight me.   
You have taken my city
and murder my people.   
You will face me.   
Or will you hide behind your slaves?   
You have Uhtred's eyes. Perhaps I shall
keep them when I'm finished with you.   
What's this?   
 She was helping
some others escape. She went for me.   
There is no cause
for more bloodshed, Brida.   
Hella is a good servant,
she can be useful to you.   
Mm.   
What do you say, girl, hm?   
Will you make yourself useful?   
   
Good.   
   
   
   
Let her death be a warning to all of you   
who would stand
beside the Dane slayer's daughter.   
   
   
Keep moving!   
   
Make the square.   
Fight me, Brida.   
   
You're no warrior.   
I am the Queen of Eoferwic.   
I am my father's daughter.   
Perhaps you're afraid
the gods will favor me?   
You know nothing of the gods.   
Make the square.   
   
Do not do this, Stiorra! Do not fight!   
   
   
We're in the city.   
Make a square!   
   
   
Well, now I know what a turd feels like.   
   
   
   
Stiorra.   
 Stiorra, don't do this!   
   
[Uhtred] You know what to do,
move quickly.   
Don't fight, Stiorra!   
[Uhtred] We go on your signal.   
   
   
   
   
   
Shh.   
   
   
[Sihtric] I'll get you out, be ready.   
   
   
   
   
[Finan] Come on, you bastards, you!   
Ha-ha!   
   
   
   
   
    
    
Brida!    
Ah! You should not have come
for my children, Brida.    
It's not like the little priest
was using his cock.    
    
[Stiorra] Sigtryggr!    
[Sigtryggr] Stiorra!
    
    
[Pyrlig] Hold back some men
to help the townsfolk.    
[Pyrlig] Be ready!    
    
    
Vibeke, hide until I come for you.    
    
    
    
    
[Pyrlig] To the woods! Hide yourselves!    
[Pyrlig] Take cover!    
    
    
    
Vibeke!    
    
[Brida] Vibeke! Vibeke, hold on!    
Mother! Mother!    
    
Vibeke, the gods will protect you!    
Child, get back from the edge.
Mother!    
Vibeke!    
[Brida] Come to me.    
Don't go to him.    
[Uhtred] Do not be afraid.
Give me your hand.    
Jump to me!    
Vibeke. Jump to me. The gods are with us.
Brida, no!    
Give me your hand.
[Brida] Trust me, we can do this.    
You can do this, trust me.    
I will catch you!    
No!
[Brida] Vibeke!    
Vibeke!    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
Retreat! Retreat!    
    
Take him.    
[Rognvaldr] I'm Sigtryggr's brother.
I'm Sigtryggr's brother!    
Sigtryggr, she made me.    
She made me!    
    
    
    
    
    
[Stiorra] I knew you would come.    
 You fought well, Stiorra.    
[Stiorra] Brida escaped.    
Why did you let her live?    
Her child lay dead. There'd have been
no honor in taking advantage of her grief.    
She'll find more to follow her.    
Now is the time to end this.    
We lost so many of our people.
    
If you don't go after her, I will.
I will. I will.    
Finan.    
Sihtric. Fetch our men from Rumcofa.
The victory feasting will have to wait.    
What... What is it, Lord?    
We must ride after Brida.    
Now.    
Uh, Lord, I must speak with you...    
Fetch Father Pyrlig.
He will be with the townspeople.    
Then stay here and make sure
the rest of the city is secured.    
    
Brother, I have wronged you.
    
I was deceived by the witch.    
You will be silent.
    
Wait! Please!    
I fought with you!    
No, you saw the tide turn
and sought only to save yourself.    
I saved your life.    
We're brothers.    
We're blood.    
    
    
[Pyrlig] To the woods!
Hide there until it's safe to come back.    
These men will take you to the others,
do not be afraid.    
    
You might as well have a bell
around your neck, boy.    
[Aethelstan] I'm sorry.    
[Uhtred] Look, bodies.    
[Uhtred] She came this way.    
Maybe we should fetch the others.    
    
 I'm sorry.    
Your first battle, it is common.    
I emptied my guts into my brother
Ragnar's helmet after my first.    
You did well. Fetch the others,
tell them Brida is traveling north.    
I'll go ahead.
Uhtred, no.    
Brida escaped,
it was not your doing, you know that.    
You must stop blaming yourself.    
She did not escape.    
I let her go.    
    
Can this be true?    
The priest was quite certain
Lady Aethelflaed will not see the spring.    
The king has received no word
from his sister.    
It seems she will not seek
the support of Wessex    
before she names her successor.    
She only needs
the Mercian Witan's approval.    
They will all seek the throne
for their own sons.    
Whoever she names
will have a bloody battle on his hands.    
Mm.    
Unless she intends the throne
for the Lady Aelfwynn.    
 Her daughter?    
What, you really think the Witan would
put aside their own ambitions so easily?    
They won't like it,
but there is an argument to be made    
for peaceful continuity.    
It avoids the infighting,
which we saw at Aethelred's passing.    
But perhaps that is not the only solution.    
You have someone in mind?
Who better than my grandson Aelfweard?    
He is nephew to the lady.    
He is a far more suitable choice
to continue her line    
and he is young enough that the ealdormen
will believe they can influence him.    
They will need persuading.    
 Indeed.    
We must proceed with caution.    
Find out how loyal
the Witan are to Aethelflaed.    
I can send word to our friends
in Aegelesburg.    
Yes. Do it quickly.
This will not stay secret long.    
Mm. Not if that arseling priest
has anything to do with it.    
[Sihtric] Lord!    
If Brida passed this way,
it was hours ago.    
We could always return at daybreak, Lord.    
With more men from Eoferwic,
we could spread the search wider.    
It will be too late. We must keep looking.    
The trail is cold, Uhtred.    
    
We return to Eoferwic!    
You will find her.    
Yes, I will.    
Lord King.    
I've had word from Mercia
that my men never reached Sigtryggr.    
Aethelflaed sent no help to Eoferwic.    
[Aethelhelm] I see.
I do not understand it.    
Why would my sister endanger
the peace so recklessly?    
Perhaps the Lady Aethelflaed has done
what Wessex should have done long ago    
and cut ties with the enemy within.    
No, this is not like her.    
And why has there been no word
from Pyrlig?     
I will send a messenger to Aegelesburg.
We are missing something.    
    
Come on, you need to drink
to your first victory.    
This is the part where we usually enjoy
the gratitude of the local women.    
If Brida left any.    
I was blind.    
I opened the gates
and I let the wolves among my people.    
You led us to victory.
Eoferwic is restored, Stiorra's safe.    
They have all betrayed me.
Not just the one I called brother.    
I've been weak. I kept silent
as the Christians poisoned my people.    
I share your anger.    
But the truce is held...
The truce? There was no truce.    
It was all lies and trickery.    
The Christians' words are as false
as the God they pretend to love.    
And I was a fool to trust them.    
I think you're wrong.    
Why? Why do you defend them?
If Brida had threat Christian Mercia,    
do you think Edward would have looked
the other way?    
But when Danes are under attack,
he turns against us.    
Uhtred, we are heathens to be sacrificed,
nothing more.    
Pyrlig said Edward did send men to Mercia
intended for your aid.    
You have won how many battles for them?    
This is how they repay you?    
They dishonor you.
They abandon your daughter?    
They do not have your oath.    
They forfeit your allegiance.    
Swear your loyalty to me.    
Stand beside your kin.    
[Sigtryggr] Hm?    
    
My place is in Rumcofa.    
[Sigtryggr] Mm.    
    
Father, Sigtryggr is...    
His brother's betrayal,
there's a shadow on him now.    
[Uhtred] His pride is wounded,
he needs time to heal.    
It's not just his pride,
I know you see it too.    
He needs your guidance,
he'll listen to you.    
Will you stay?    
    
[Eadith] Drink this.
It'll help you sleep, Lady.    
You have a slight fever.    
I shouldn't sleep
until Father Benedict has visited.    
My mother was never going to let me
travel home without a priest.    
Benedict is here, my dearest.    
The lady should rest tonight.
She is weakened from the journey.    
She will be healed by God's grace,
not your potions.    
 Will you help me
with my robe, Eadith?    
    
The sacrament of healing will restore you.    
 "And the apostle said
unto them, 'Is any sick among you?    
Let him summon the priests of the church.    
And let them pray over him,
anointing him with oil,    
in the name of the Lord.'"    
God is good.    
Per istam sanctan 
unctionem et suam... 
piissimam misericordiam... 
indulgeat tibi... 
Dominus quidquid per visum... 
deliquisti. 
    
Our friends in Mercia have sent word.    
They say the Lady Aethelflaed
has allies among the ealdormen,    
but there are more who harbor bitterness
at her successes.    
Then they will name Aelfweard as Lord
when the time comes?    
 I believe most
will be led by their greed.    
[Aethelhelm] Mm.    
You must leave immediately.    
Make sure the Witan feels...    
    
...adequately respected.    
What if the lady returns
before I reach the ealdormen?    
That cannot happen. You must reach
Aegelesburg before she does.    
I will follow with Aelfweard,
once I have broken the news to the king.    
The palace is stirring.    
I must not be seen here.     
It is early yet.
    
Your wife has engaged me
in duties of the court.    
    
I believe I am to divert my energies
towards the art of embroidery.    
Ah.
    
I hear she is greatly enthused
by a farm girl    
who was blessed with a visitation
from St... Cuthbert, I think.    
The queen wishes the ladies of Winchester    
to construct a grand tapestry
in the saint's honor.    
Of course she does.    
In truth, I think she wishes
to keep an eye on me.    
I will deal with her.
No, there's no need.    
I do not wish to cause her pain.    
You will return tonight?    
Is that my king's command?    
It is my hope.    
    
A thousand pardons for the hour...    
Lord Aethelhelm.    
Well?    
[Aethelhelm]    
There is no easy way
to deliver news of this kind.    
I have received sad tidings from Mercia.    
Your sister is gravely ill, Lord King.    
She is not long for this world.    
Impossible.    
There is no doubt.
No.    
Why would your spies learn this
before the king?    
We have seen in the past    
how the matter of the Mercian succession
can give rise to disorder.    
I imagine the lady wished    
to keep the matter of her condition secret
for as long as possible.    
It cannot be.    
I am deeply sorry.    
    
Of course, this explains why
the lady did not raise the Mercian army    
to aid Eoferwic.    
In any case, there are reports
that Sigtryggr has recaptured his city.    
A small mercy.    
Thank you, Lord Aethelhelm.    
You will travel to Mercia?    
Forgive me,
I will intrude on your grief no longer.    
    
    
[Finan] Lord.
Finan, did you find Pyrlig?    
Uh, I searched until nightfall,
there was no sign.    
He must have traveled back to the king.
That is not like him.    
Uhtred, forgive me. We... We must speak.    
We go after Brida.
We can talk on the journey.    
 It's the Lady Aethelflaed.    
    
Lord Aldhelm!    
[Eadith] She lives but her strength fades. 
She doesn't want her condition to be known
until matters are resolved.    
She will need your help
to enter the palace.    
    
 She...
She will not see the spring.    
    
But she was in good health in Rumcofa.    
You must be mistaken in this, Finan.    
I... I wish I was mistaken.    
She does not have long.    
And you concealed this from me?    
Eadith begged me to wait until the battle
was won before I told you.    
Your mind was on your daughter.
It would've been wrong    
for me to add to your troubles.    
I'm sorry, Uhtred.    
It cannot be.    
It cannot be.    
You have loved each other for many years.    
We've all seen it,
even if the lady cannot speak of it.    
So I know the pain you've carried
since she took her vow.    
She would want you to be with her, Uhtred.
You must go to her.    
I thought one day we might...    
I thought there would be more...    
    
There is so much I should have said.    
There's still time.    
We ride to Aegelesburg!    
Stiorra!    
[Stiorra] Father?
    
Father?    
Lady Aethelflaed is dying.    
I'm so sorry, Father.    
I must go to her.    
If Mercia finds itself without a leader
once more, you must be careful.    
You could come with us.    
It could help
heal the rift between your lands.    
No, my place is here with Sigtryggr.    
Yes, it is.    
    
    
    
We must keep moving.    
    
What about the last one?
Should I kill him here?    
Um...    
He comes with us.    
The gods delivered him to me.    
They will show me why.    
Mother?    
I am here.    
 Aelfwynn.
Where... Where is she?    
The child should not see you this way,
dear one.    
Let us wait until you are a little better.    
Aelfwynn must be named as my successor.    
If she is on the throne,
she will be protected.    
I will fetch Lady Aelfwynn.    
[Aelfwynn] He's here.    
He's here. Come and look! Come!    
    
    
Hey!    
    
Lady Aelfwynn.    
Your mother.    
[Aelfwynn] Is this about
how I brought shame on her in Rumcofa?    
What more can there be to say
on the matter?    
Lady Aethelflaed only wishes
to speak with you.    
My mother wishes only to chide me
for doing what she cannot.    
Your mother has given
everything she has for Mercia!    
To protect her people,
to protect you, her only child.    
You're not just her hope for the future of
this kingdom. You're her heart, Aelfwynn.    
She thinks only of you.    
Come. She is eager to see you.    
Do you understand?    
Knowing my daughter will be Lady of Mercia
in my stead, it is all I wish.    
    
It will mean you are safe, Aelfwynn.    
You must agree to this.    
I'm not ready.
[Aethelflaed] Listen to me.    
Word of my condition will spread.    
There are those who would seek to take
the throne for their own advancement.    
If they are successful,    
the first thing they will do is ensure
my daughter is disposed of.    
[Aelswith] You frighten the child.    
She needs to know the truth.
There is no time...    
[Aethelflaed]    
It fades.    
Mother.    
Do you suffer greatly?    
 Do not be afraid.    
I know there is much you must sacrifice.    
It is a choice I also faced.    
I do not pretend it was easy.    
But you will not be alone.    
    
[Aelfwynn] I will be strong.    
    
    
I'll do as you wish.
I'll serve as queen when you're gone.    
The Witan will stand behind you.    
I am sure of it.    
    
    
Come now, Aelfwynn.    
Let us visit the church together.    
    
    
Mother?    
You must rest.    
    
[Aldhelm] It pains her
to see you this way.    
It is a dreadful thing to...    
to face the loss of a child.    
[Aethelflaed]    
I hope you know I am grateful.    
Oh, uh... 
Lady, there's no... no need.    
Will you do me one more service,
Lord Aldhelm?    
Anything.    
My daughter is young and willful.    
I know she is not ready.    
You must be her guide.    
Her advisor.    
She needs you.    
Mercia needs you.    
Of course. It will be my honor.    
No one has served Mercia more faithfully.    
[Aethelflaed]    
We must act quickly.    
I will seek out the ealdormen.    
    
Thank you, Aldhelm.    
    
If this sad news is true,    
how is it Wessex has learned of it
before the ealdormen of Mercia?    
Lord Aethelhelm has many friends
across the kingdoms.    
All of you know the young Lady Aelfwynn
is not fit to rule.    
Does your master propose
an alternative solution?    
He does indeed, Lord Burgred.    
One he trusts you will all find...    
    
...advantageous.    
    
    
We are greatly blessed to welcome Aalys
and her pilgrims to Winchester.    
[Edward] Indeed.    
This is the young woman from Lewes?    
You see, the tapestry tells
of the deeds of St. Cuthbert,    
the saint she was visited by.    
[Aethelhelm] Hm, remarkable.    
It is important the people see
your recognition of this miracle, Edward.    
Are you pleased with our work?    
God's glory shines through your laborers,
my Lady.    
We will be glad to carry your offering
to the Holy Isle.    
You will take this to Lindisfarne?
With your approval, Lord King.    
You see, when I heard Aalys was making
the pilgrimage to the Holy Isle,    
I knew you'd like to make
a king's blessing to their offering.    
It means so much to your people.    
Of course.
God be with you on your journey.    
    
Do you understand
that your show of piety may be seen    
as Wessex laying claim to the Holy Isle?    
King Constantin wants Lindisfarne
for Scotland.    
He could see this
as a deliberate act of provocation.    
I did not know.    
[Edward]    
You did not ask.    
[Aalys] Lady.    
God knows your heart.    
He feels your pain as His own.
    
I will pray for you.    
That you will know God's will
for your life and His peace in your heart.    
    
    
[Aethelhelm] This is not the moment
for you to provoke the king's displeasure.    
[Aelflaed] He disrespects me.    
And you will bear it
for the sake of your son.    
He is the only reason
we have a place here.    
I am aware of that,
but I'm tired of waiting...    
Aelfweard will be Lord of Mercia
within the week.    
There will be a Witan
when the Lady Aethelflaed dies.    
And my grandson will be named
her successor.    
He has bribed the Mercian ealdormen.
It is the only explanation.    
How long has he known
of my sister's plight?    
What will you do?    
[Edward] Lord Aethelhelm.    
I will ride to Aegelesburg.    
God willing, my sister will be spared
long enough to receive us.    
A wise decision, Lord.    
I think it would be right if your son
were to travel with the delegation,    
Aelfweard is very fond of his aunt.    
Perhaps I could accompany him?    
He may be some comfort
to his cousin Aelfwynn.    
The poor girl.    
    
[Finan] You'll see her, Lord.
We'll not be too late!    
Sigtryggr! Brother!    
Sigtryggr!    
Sigtryggr!    
Sigtryggr!    
Brother!    
Sigtryggr!    
Sigtryggr! Brother!
    
I know it is not an easy thing,
to condemn your brother to die.    
We are family!    
    
You are tenderhearted.    
That's why I love you.    
 I know I must act.    
He must answer for his crimes.    
 But all my life
I have protected him.    
I do not know what to do.    
He does not deserve your mercy.    
Perhaps we could let the gods decide.    
    
Brother.    
 Brother!    
Brother.    
[Sigtryggr] We are decided.    
You may choose a quick death here,
or you may trust your fate    
to a public trial,
but you must choose now.    
 A trial?    
[Stiorra] It's what you pretended to want
when you came here, wasn't it?    
A trial for your people under Danelaw?    
    
I know you.    
I know you are just.    
You're merciful.    
You will not condemn me.    
Choose!    
    
    
You brought them here!    
    
    
The prisoner will take the bar
in both hands!    
He will take nine steps,    
for the nine nights Odin hung
on the great tree.    
If he succeeds, the gods have favored him
and he will be pardoned.    
But if he fails, the gods have cursed him.    
And my sword is ready!    
    
Brother, I...    
We begin!    
    
    
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SEASON: 05
EPISODE: 02
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[Uhtred] I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred. 
My daughter, Stiorra, and her husband,
Sigtryggr, have an unwelcome guest, 
Sigtryggr's treacherous brother,
Rognvaldr... 
Why do you agree
when he seeks to come between us?  
...who secretly plots against them. 
  
[Uhtred] My beloved Aethelflaed
has visited us in Rumcofa. 
Some say I came to see you.  
I wish that were true,
but I think it is not.   
[Uhtred] And my liegeman Cynlaef has found
favor with her daughter, Aelfwynn. 
Go and help the Lady Aelfwynn
off her horse.   
[Uhtred] Aethelflaed brought a holy man,
Father Benedict. 
[Uhtred] Rumcofa does not need a priest.   
He's an exceptionally gifted scholar.
He's a gambler.   
Make sure he gives that back.   
[Uhtred] Brida has returned
with her daughter, Vibeke, 
believed to be a seer. 
[Brida] The seer has chosen.   
[Uhtred] Her hatred of me and my family
still burns like a poison. 
[Aldhelm] Who did this to you?
Brida!    
[Uhtred] And now she has invade Eoferwic, 
spreading pain and terror
through the city. 
Find Stiorra!   
[Uhtred] Destiny is all! 
   
Find Stiorra! Find Uhtred's daughter!   
   
   
   
   
   
[Stiorra] Leave him, it is done.   
   
   
   
   
   
Go and play.   
   
She is nothing to fear!   
She's here to rescue you,
turn you back to the gods.   
   
[Rognvaldr] Do not fight them, brother.   
She has the power. Yield!   
   
   
Oh!   
   
   
   
   
   
   
Jesus, save us.   
   
Yield!   
She will do it again.
   
   
Sigtryggr,
for the sake of your people, yield.   
   
   
   
King Sigtryggr. How you have thrived.   
What is this madness?   
It is not madness to honor the gods.   
You do not speak for the gods.
Our gods do not need a priestess!   
You follow her like Christian sheep?!   
   
   
Where is his wife?   
Let me find her.   
Rognvaldr, no.   
Rognvaldr, no!   
Leave her be!   
   
   
[Brida] You little dog, huh?   
   
No longer the man he was.   
Christians have a story for it.   
   
Stiorra...!   
 We're coming for you!   
Stiorra!   
   
[Rognvaldr] Stiorra? Stiorra, come out!   
[Rognvaldr] Show Brida you're sorry
for letting your people stray.   
[Rognvaldr] She will forgive you.   
   
You!
   
Where is your mistress?   
 I have not seen her,
Lord. She has left.   
   
 This way.
   
   
   
Harder.
Please, I cannot.   
   
[Brida] Where is she?    
 She says she has fled
with her women.    
[Brida] Is this true?
    
[Brida] Come on, you can trust me.    
It would be foolish to lie, girl.    
    
    
    
    
    
[Brida] Search every home,
bring me hostages.    
I want anyone who could be Stiorra
lined up in the square! Bring the water.    
[Rognvaldr] Brida!    
Allow him to live
and he will come to you as I did. Please.    
Let me teach him
how we worship the gods with purity.    
All this to prove yourself
to your brother?    
To get the chance to lead him?
I will not follow this perversion.    
I lead these people
and I will die their king.    
As you wish. kill him.    
[Brida] No!    
You kill him.    
He's my kin.    
[Brida] He has betrayed our gods.    
He allowed the Christians
to take root here and poison our brothers.    
kill him, hm?    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
You have shown me you're loyal. Good.    
Now I've shown you all I act with justice,
you will come and welcome me in time.    
I set you free, Danes of Jorvik.    
Open the gates. Open them!    
    
Find Uhtred.    
I will not leave my people to your mercy.    
We will find your wife, you know we will.    
So I offer you this bargain.    
I will spare her life,
only if you bring me Uhtred.    
    
    
 Sigtryggr!    
    
 There you go.
 Thank you.    
    
    
Do not give up hope.    
Sit with him, your voice might wake him.
And say what?    
What words are there for this?    
How can I tell him he is no longer a man?    
Tell him he is still your son.    
    
Uh, the scouts are returning
from the hillside.    
I will send for you should he wake.    
[Osferth] Nothing to the east,
nothing upriver, nothing downriver.    
I don't think she's here, Lord.    
    
    
    
I have no wish to harm you, huh?    
Only make you see
how you have fallen from the path.    
    
On your knees.    
    
On your knees.    
On your knees, all of you!    
You will stay like that until your Stiorra
saves you from your agony.    
Stiorra, show yourself!
Do not let these women suffer!    
    
You must stay here.    
[Finan] Hey! Don't leave your guard!    
You piss and shit where you stand.    
I should return to my post.    
I'm needed on the bankside.
If Brida attacks, she will torture us all.    
I am a woman of royal blood.    
It's my duty to be tortured.    
[Finan] Lord, stand down.    
Let me take over the watch.
No. We must keep all the men ready.    
Lord, rest.    
We have men everywhere.    
We'll not be taken by surprise.
I am already outplayed, Finan.    
You couldn't have known.
I did.    
I always knew she would return.    
I just thought she would attack me,
not you.    
Nor my son.    
It is a grievous wound,
but your son can survive it.    
Survive perhaps, but live?    
Have no child, no legacy.    
[Aldhelm] Uhtred!    
I have grave news from across the country.    
Stiorra? She has attacked Eoferwic?    
How did you know?
She's coming for my bloodline.    
Stand down the men. We will be leaving.    
How long has it been like this?
Less than a year.    
A year?    
[Eadith] Does this hurt...
Yes.    
Yes, it does.
Have you shown this to anyone else?    
    
The healers in Mercia
are not to be trusted.    
Any sign the queen sickens
and the ealdormen plot civil war.    
I do wish, Lady,
that you had shown someone.    
To excise this now might be... May I?    
Well, I... I thought
perhaps it might heal itself.    
I have had others that have done so.    
I fear this will not heal itself.    
    
I know that taking a knife to it
might be dangerous, but I am prepared.    
I am not sure we can remove it.
Curtail it then, perhaps?    
It seems to grow rather rapidly now.    
It grows as the flesh falls from my belly.    
May I just...?    
Is this beyond your skill?    
Have I misjudged your reputation?    
Lady, I fear it is too late
to save you from this canker.    
You have seen this before.    
Only on...    
Were you going to say "only on the dead"?    
Yes, Lady, I was.    
My heart breaks, I have no words.    
Well, then,
I must attend to urgent matters.    
The Mercian succession,    
how we maintain peace.     
No, I would urge you instead to spend
your time with those that you love.    
You are clearly unfamiliar
with the demands of ruling a kingdom.    
    
Do not cry.    
There is much to do. I am still myself.    
    
Lady Aethelflaed is sleeping
and should not be disturbed.    
She will want to hear this.    
No. As Father Benedict says,
she should not be disturbed.    
Aldhelm, my daughter is in danger.    
She is attending to matters for Mercians
and Mercians alone.    
She asks you prepare her mother for mass.
The lady invites you in.    
What is the news that cannot wait?    
Eoferwic has fallen
and my daughter is in danger.    
Then I share your pain, Lord Uhtred.    
So we ride out with the men of Rumcofa,
retake the town for Sigtryggr.    
I cannot.
Why?    
Mercia cannot be distracted.
Distracted?    
The men of Rumcofa will be needed here.    
We cannot take them to Eoferwic.
Why?    
We need to turn our efforts inward,
look to securing Mercia.    
But this is madness!
Brida's on your border!    
And if she crosses into our lands...
Then we will be too late!    
Please do not question me.
Then do not behave with such foolishness.    
I have spoken!    
We shall return to Aegelesburg. You may
take a dozen of the men of Rumcofa.    
But what of Stiorra?    
[Uhtred] Aethelflaed...    
what of my daughter?    
Trust that I have good reason to refuse.    
You're like the worst of your father.    
Uhtred...
[Uhtred] And you a coward!    
I will do this alone,
even if you give me nothing!    
How you've changed.    
    
How you have not.    
    
I'm assuming Lady Eadith
did not have welcome news.    
Should I have told him?    
No.    
He would have been fighting Brida
with a broken heart.    
As all our hearts are broken, Lady.    
This news is... unbearable.    
And yet we shall bear it.    
Both of us.    
My father faced death
with a soul that was prepared.    
He knew his dream would outlive him
and he did not grieve his loss.    
And nor shall I.    
    
Raise a dozen men loyal to us.    
We will go to the Saxon boroughs
bordering Eoferwic, get their assistance.    
She's only given you a dozen?    
To retake a town?
You did mention Brida, didn't you, Lord?    
The boroughs along the border
have fought with us.    
They have an interest
in seeing Brida dead.    
[Uhtred] Are you sure you're ready?    
    
I'm certain.    
Stiorra saved my life as a child,
I owe her this.    
Find him a faster horse.
Lord.    
If there is mortal danger,
I ask that you ride away from it.    
Do not think of us, just run.    
Can you do that?    
 I'm just as good a fighter
as any of your men.    
[Uhtred] You're also a greater prize.    
Aethelstan, if you're captured...
Then I'll say the truth, that I'm no one.    
Not yet, no.    
How would you like us to respond?    
We should signal support.
Sigtryggr has been a strong ally.    
That said,
Eoferwic is on my sister's border.    
[Pyrlig] Indeed. She may wish to lead
a counterattack without our interference.    
Send     north to support her army.    
Make it clear they're under her command.
Lord.    
I have news from Eoferwic, Lord.    
Your spies are too slow, Lord Aethelhelm.
I already know and have acted.    
Then you are readying your troops
to make haste there?    
[Edward] No, I will not.    
They will not reach Eoferwic
before Aethelflaed's men of Rumcofa,    
it is wiser we follow her lead.    
Is it?    
Whilst I am loathe
to spill the blood of Wessex,    
does this not offer an opportunity?    
[Edward] How so?    
Eoferwic is the gateway to Northumbria.    
Take it and three quarters of England
will be under your control.    
There are other ways to regain Eoferwic
from the heathens.    
With respect,
your missionaries, by now, are dead.    
Still, I am a young enough man
to think in years, not months.    
If you think I've forsaken Alfred's dream,
you are mistaken.    
You are wasting a chance!    
Use this moment,
kill Brida and kill Sigtryggr.    
I will not kill Sigtryggr,
he has behaved peacefully towards us.    
Or appears to.    
Are we really to believe
that this is Dane infighting?    
Is it not more likely
that he invited Brida to form an alliance?    
Our information says different
and I am confident in it.    
Not everyone intrigues as you do,
my Lord Aethelhelm.    
Very well.    
I have done my duty,
I have offered my advice.    
The ealdormen will be disappointed.    
I'm not certain
you speak for the ealdormen.    
He is unwise to keep questioning me.    
He feels time slipping
and his standing diminish.    
A war could bring him influence.
Mm.    
Still, go north.
Assess the situation for yourself.    
But what of the matters of state?    
You may delegate them to the king.    
There was nothing in what Aethelhelm said,
that Sigtryggr planned this?    
No.    
Lord Aethelhelm is simply looking to start
a battle so you come begging him for coin.    
He wishes you beholden to him
because you're not.    
You are to inform the Saxon boroughs
on Sigtryggr's border    
not to give troops to assist him.    
He is to be offered no safe harbor,
no support.    
That is the word of the king, is it?    
If asked, he would deny it.    
Thought I was going after
the young bastard.    
Yes.    
After you have finished playing messenger,
you may return to Rumcofa.    
Say what you want, we're leaving.    
I thought I should say my farewells.    
Why? Because you have sent me to my death?    
You risk me. You risk Aethelstan.    
You have men
and you have fire in your heart.    
You will achieve what you set out to do.    
But if I do not see you again...
You will see me again.    
If I die, I will haunt you
to the end of your days.    
    
No, no, no. Make your peace.
[Finan] Oh, they'll find peace.    
[Finan] They've loved each other
a long time.    
No, as soon as this is done,
make him return to find her.    
[Finan] He'll probably sulk
until the summer.    
Finan, wait!    
    
I am forbidden from speaking
what I will say next.    
Swear you will keep it
until he has rescued his daughter?    
Alright.    
    
The lady will not be here next summer.    
She is dying.    
What?    
That is why she could not offer help.
There will be trouble in Mercia.    
But she seemed herself.
That is taking all her strength.    
No, no, no. You cannot tell him.
He must not be distracted from this fight.    
I have never lied to him.    
I know.    
But sadly, it is not a burden
you will have to bear for long.    
    
    
Are you ready for this?
Uh... Uh, yes.    
It has been a while
since we went to fight.    
[Finan] Can't wait.
I'm desperate to wield a sword again.    
Go, you're getting in my way.    
I love you.    
And I know it is hard.
But we will return to them.    
I swear.    
    
    
To Eoferwic!    
Who is next?    
    
[Edward] No. No.    
I... I cannot hear
another quarrel between you.    
Leave Winchester
until you have resolved your dispute.    
 My King.    
    
[Edward] Yes, what is your case?
I am here to avenge my father's death.    
That at least sounds interesting.    
A man named Goda killed him
and claimed the lands he gave to me.    
I want them back.
Yes, I have read this one.    
 Lady Eadgifu?
Yes, Lord King, of Cent.    
I have a great fondness for Cent.    
I spent many happy times there
as a younger man.    
Yes.    
Yes, as a boy, I recall,
you were brought to Cantwaraburg.    
My father, the ealdorman,
held a feast for yours, the great king.    
Yes. Yes, now I think you are familiar.    
If I am correct, I was given your horse
to ride and you were not happy.    
    
Indeed.    
Yes, as a girl, I cared far more
for horses than for boys.    
Well, may I be forgiven for
not remembering, it was a long time ago.    
We are all much changed. You have grown
into the true heir of a great kingdom...    
Perhaps we could hear
the other side of this dispute.    
Where is this Goda?    
With respect, it is not in dispute.    
The man has stolen property
that is rightfully mine.    
It is not in contention,
he is in the wrong.    
[Edward] Yes.    
Yes.    
Look, having read the details    
from Father Pyrlig, I concur
that you have been done an injustice.    
Have this Goda brought
before the Ealdorman of Cent.    
And this decrees your stolen land
as folkland which I may now return to you.    
Thank you.     
I am most grateful, my King.    
I shall trouble you no longer.    
    
No.    
The business is done for this evening.    
Lady Eadgifu?    
Eat with us.    
I... wish to hear news from Cent.    
Lord King, I would be honored.    
I simply do not understand
what you are trying to tell me.    
The delay has not favored me.    
So Eadith's cure is to be harsher?
[Aethelflaed] No.    
It is too late to enact a cure.    
Well, that I do not understand.    
Explain to me, yourself,
why your cure will fail.    
[Aethelflaed]    
It is simple.    
I am dying.    
No, you are not.
Tell her.    
[Aelswith] No, do not. I will not listen.    
I am not going to take the words
of a prattler who has deceived us!    
Mother, that is unfair.    
No.    
What is unfair    
is telling us it could be cured
and then failing to cure it!    
Lady, I never told you that...
Do not speak to me!    
Do not!    
    
Will you console her?
I do not have the strength.    
Of course, Lady.    
May I ask how long you think?    
I believe you will not see the spring.    
And I shall endeavor to relieve any pain.    
I do not want to be here.    
I want to return to Aegelesburg.    
Then we must travel
before you grow too weak.    
I know not why the Lord wills this.    
Yet, speak of it to no one.    
 I must tell my daughter. Aldhelm.    
    
Mother!    
What is your name?
Cynlaef, Lady.    
And you are training as a warrior?
Uh...    
Yes, Lady.    
Lord Aldhelm, ensure Cynlaef here
is sent upriver to fight the raiders.    
And accompany Lady Aelfwynn
in an advance party home.    
No, please, that is not fair!
Lady, I mean no harm to anyone.    
Then I would find some fire
as the raiders can be merciless.    
Why would you be so cruel to me?    
Why? I try only to live as other girls do.    
You are not any other girl.    
You are heir to Mercia
and as such must be chaste.    
Why?
Because that is the way things are!    
    
I have sacrificed everything,
everything to secure our kingdom.    
You cannot throw it away
like a cheap ale yard whore!    
Better a whore than a frustrated witch.
Do not speak to your queen in that way.    
Or you will come to regret it.    
Now you will return to Aegelesburg    
and think about what it means
to rule there.    
I have thought about it.
It is a punishment.    
Nonetheless,
it is what is planned for you.    
[Aethelflaed] I know you are young,
but look beyond yourself.    
To be a queen is an honor.    
There is no greater destiny.    
Destiny is for arselings.    
I do not want it!    
    
    
    
And that's what happens when a boy
spends too long with his mother.    
Do not turn immediately,
but he has arrived with another woman.    
She is still here.    
Normally they do not last the night.    
The women of Cent
are a law unto themselves.    
But they tend to be sensible.    
I'll deal with it.    
    
How much?    
My Lord?
Coin.    
How much coin do you want?    
Coin, Lord? For what?
To return to your estate.    
Well, I have only just arrived
and the road is long.    
Then we will find you
the strongest horses.    
What is it that women like you appreciate?
Gold? Silks?    
Some spices, remedies?    
Name your price.    
Thirty pieces of silver.
That is the cost of betrayal, I believe.    
A woman who knows the scripture.
Mm. Alfred's learning is strong in Cent.    
Then you will do the clever thing
and accept my offer.    
And if I do not?    
 I don't know.    
They always tend to comply.    
    
You may sit.    
[Brida] Two days. [sniffs] Two days
and still Stiorra makes you suffer.    
I am here as a mother,
to see a better future for our children.    
Daneland restored for Danes
and Danes alone.    
Now, the gods gave us fair winds
and calm seas to carry us here.    
For this, they deserve a sacrifice.    
Bring her forth.    
    
Vibeke, we're ready.    
Show us who is honored.    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
This cannot be.    
I am needed alive to serve the gods!    
This cannot be!    
Brida?    
The gods speak through the seer!    
But five is enough.    
They will be satisfied with this.
    
    
    
Let me go. She will show no mercy.    
Your husband will come.    
Wait for his command.    
    
Come out! I can feel your eyes on me!    
Come out and face me!    
[Pyrlig] We have no fight.    
Are you a Dane of Eoferwic?    
No. I'm Sigtryggr of Jorvik
and I am king there.    
Forgive me. I mean no disrespect.    
I am...
Father Pyrlig.    
Advisor to King Edward.    
Where is Uhtred?
We expect him with the men from Rumcofa.    
I am the vanguard, but the king
is sending his sister reinforcements.    
And yet I have heard nothing
and seen less.    
The Saxons will fight for you,
you're no longer alone.    
Good.    
We meet these armies,
take my homestead, kill the bitch.    
    
    
    
Right away, sir.    
I do not want this.    
W... What is it?    
Lord Aethelhelm offered me money to leave.    
I did not ask him to do that.
Then why would he do it?    
Lord King, I am not foolish.    
I know your favor to me
was merely a passing desire. But I...    
 I did not expect to be treated
as a common whore.    
That decision was Lord Aethelhelm's alone.
He seeks to thwart me on many things.    
Then do not suffer him.    
He has friends and he is kin.    
I am sorry for this offense.    
Well, I am sorry for your troubles
as they seem to make you heartsore.    
That is the first kindness
I have been shown in quite a while.    
Well, my father was an ealdorman
and I knew the care of it was troublesome.    
I can only imagine
how much worse it is for you.    
Perhaps you need not imagine it.    
Perhaps you could stay
and see it for a while.    
For yourself, with me.    
    
Yes, I should like that.    
For all its strangeness,
I did find our time together enjoyable.    
    
Faster. You piss like an old man.    
 Die, priest.    
[Finan] Oh, you dribbled
on yourself there, Father?    
No, it's holy water.    
    
Where are the men of Rumcofa?
Uh, yes, not good news on that.    
[Uhtred] Sigtryggr!    
What news of Stiorra?    
[Sigtryggr] She was alive when I left,
but Brida hunts her. There's no time.    
We will reach her.    
We will save her.    
She claims to act for Danes.    
It is you she wants, it is you.
You have found me.    
You have done all you can.    
Where is the army of Rumcofa?
The lady would not offer them.    
[Sigtryggr] I thought the king sent men.
He has.    
I do not understand...
No matter.    
I have sent word
to the Saxon boroughs on your border.    
Why would the lady refuse?
We have an alliance!    
For years we have had peace!
[Uhtred] I know! It is a betrayal.    
Is this Edward's decision?
No, it is not.    
What news of the borough men?
The boroughs say they can offer nothing.    
They claim they have no men
stationed there.    
Then they lie.
There are more than a hundred there.    
I know the Saxon defenses around my lands.    
They also say King Edward
has sent an order, Lord.    
No one's to come to King Sigtryggr's aid.
I know nothing of this.    
It is a mistake!    
Then if I have to do this alone, I shall.
You will not be doing this alone.    
Lords, we cannot take Eoferwic
with this number.    
But if we can get in and I kill Brida...
She'll have men within protecting her.    
I have men within
and they will be loyal to me.    
You take this band outside the gates,
we can bring townspeople out to you.    
We still need to get into Eoferwic, Lord.    
 My wife will not die
trapped like a rat!    
I did not conquer all I have conquered
to let her suffer this!    
What are you thinking?    
I have a way in. Follow me.    
[Uhtred] Move.    
[Benedict] Welcome.    
Take some time to pray.    
[Benedict] It is simple,
but in time it will be home.    
I like it. It's like we're in the manger.    
Why have you come north so soon?    
Running a quiet errand for himself.    
I have    ...    
and this.    
I believe you owe him    .    
Yes. The rest will come.    
The man has his own debts to pay.    
I know this, I will find the money.
Lord Aethelhelm is a good friend of mine    
and I am sure he will look on me
with compassion.    
Do we speak of the same man?    
I can't go back empty-handed,
give me something.    
I have nothing to give.    
Other than things I have seen,
words I have heard.    
And what have you heard?    
    
Lady Aethelflaed is dying
and will not see the spring.    
    
Thor strikes his hammer
when he's displeased.    
But he will be appeased
if we make another offering.    
 No, please! Please, no!    
No!
    
    
    
[Stiorra] I cannot hide any longer,
I'm sorry.    
We cannot sit and wait to be saved.    
    
    
[Finan] Lord, what is he doing?    
This is madness,
we should wait until we find more men.    
Raise a fyrd at least.    
He says there is a Roman way.    
[Finan] The Romans?
    
 That's our plan?    
Have the Romans get us out of this?    
Because the last time I checked,
they all died,     years ago.    
Osferth, the flint!
    
[Sigtryggr] It was built to carry turds
from Eoferwic.    
Will it take us there?    
Perhaps.    
Perhaps is enough.    
We follow the way of turds.    
[Uhtred] Wait!    
You die before I do
and my daughter will not forgive it.    
Uh, Lord, this is a bad idea.    
The Romans protected their buildings
with ghosts.    
    
[Stiorra] Follow the water and escape.    
    
[Stiorra] Brida!    
[Stiorra] I'm coming for you!    
You will pay for this!    
Brida!    
Then show yourself!    
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SEASON: 05
EPISODE: 01
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[Uhtred] I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred. 
Edward, King of Wessex, commanded me
to raise his bastard son, Aethelstan. 
Protect him and take him to safety.  
Teach him how to be a warrior
and all you know of the Danes.  
[Uhtred] For Aethelstan has rivals
who plot against him. 
Edward's father-in-law Aethelhelm is
determined that his own line will prevail 
and he stops at nothing to see
his grandson Aelfweard on the throne. 
If the king cannot choose
between his sons,  
it may be that we need to ensure
his ally, the queen, does not survive.   
[Aethelflaed] Mother! Mother!   
[Uhtred] For many years,
my men and I protected the Mercian border, 
where we serve at the pleasure
of the Lady of Mercia. 
Aethelflaed has taken
a vow of chastity to rule alone, 
although a deep love remains between us. 
[Aethelflaed] The price
we are paying is great.   
I will miss you, Uhtred Ragnarson.   
[Uhtred] And she takes great comfort
in her precious child Aelfwynn. 
My own daughter Stiorra has made
her bond with Sigtryggr the Dane. 
We seek a homeland.   
But we do not succumb to anger.   
[Uhtred] For many years there has been
peace between Saxon and Dane. 
And of Brida? 
Nothing has been heard
since she fled Winchester. 
My love...
   
[Uhtred] And gave birth to Cnut's child. 
   
[Uhtred] But I fear that her anger
towards me still haunts her. 
Blood has been shed. More will flow.   
I will take revenge
on all those who have betrayed me   
and I will not rest
until they suffer at my hand.   
[Uhtred] Destiny is all. 
Years passed. 
And for those years we heard nothing. 
No word, no sign. 
Just quiet rumors that she had died. 
That she was reborn. 
I hoped the silence
meant that she had found peace. 
Most forgot her. 
I did not. 
And I knew, in time, she would return. 
   
   
   
   
The reckoning approaches.   
   
The gods are speaking.   
They guide the seer to choose amongst you.   
   
[Brida] The seer has chosen.   
   
We make this sacrifice
to bring good fortune.   
Show us the moment is ripe for our voyage.   
   
The waves...   
To the waves!   
   
[Brida] We sail for battle!   
Beloved friends, warriors...   
the time has come to save our people!   
   
[Brida] To war!   
[Finan] Hey, hey! I've told you before,
codfish on top of codfish.   
Lord? Do you see something?   
No.   
But something's changed.   
 The air is rotten.   
That could be me eating too much cabbage.   
[Uhtred] Something feels wrong.
I don't like it.   
   
 Lord! Lord!   
This one says he can't pay.   
Sea raiders robbed me.   
Let me guess.
The Great Rognvaldr seized his silver.   
He wants to trade the border,
he pays Mercia a toll.   
He says you still have to pay!   
[Uhtred] In coin. No produce.   
And no tin from Cornwallum
pretending to be coin.   
Iron Lord there.   
We have soldiers to feed.
It could be a lean winter.   
All the more reason
to celebrate while we can.   
It's Blood Month festival.   
I need ale and you need
to hump the tall girl from Frisia.   
The tall girl from Frisia's too tall.   
[Finan] It's border country, Lord.
You don't get to be too picky.   
   
   
   
[Uhtred] Aethelstan!   
Why have you left your post?   
[Osferth] His first hunt, Lord.
It's good luck for Blood Month, Uhtred.   
You think you're ready
to slaughter a beast?   
You know I am.   
Aethelstan says he's ready.   
What do you say?   
Yes?   
 For Blood Month!
 For Blood Month!   
   
Be careful.
The animal will fight to the death.    
Or try to hump you.    
    
Let's go kill the swine! kill the beast!
    
Blood Month!
Blood Month!    
 Blood Month!
Blood Month! Blood Month!    
Blood Month! Blood Month! Blood Month!    
Blood Month! Blood Month! Blood Month!    
[Finan] Away with you! [chuckles]
Blood Month!    
Blood Month! Blood Month! Blood Month...    
[Finan] Leave him. He's a man now.    
I should like to see it.    
Lord, I, uh, need a little help.    
    
 I'll kill you!    
 Come here!
Swine!    
    
Again?    
Come here, bitch!
    
[Finan] Right! Hey, hey! Easy, easy!
 He's mine! He's mine!    
[Finan] Split it up. Come on. Come on!    
 Get off me, you dirty whore!    
Why do they fight over you?
I... I'm...    
I've got no idea, Lord.    
Finan! Get your arse over here!    
It's 'cause all the best men
are spoken for.    
 Keep the peace!    
We're here to secure the border,
not kick the arses of drunk women!    
You can kick my arse anytime.    
[Finan] I'm going hunting with the men.    
Go on, then.    
Hey!    
    
    
[Finan] Here, piggy, piggy! [shrieking]    
Here, piggy! Whoa, whoa, whoa!    
    
    
Woo, woo!    
Ow!
[Finan] Aethelstan, you madman, you!    
[Cynlaef] Piggy, piggy, piggy!    
    
Aethelstan!
    
[Cynlaef] Aethelstan!    
    
    
    
    
    
Whose men are you?    
    
    
    
    
    
    
 Finish him!    
 Come on.    
[Aethelstan]    
    
Uhtred!    
[Aethelstan] Uhtred!    
Do you hear that?    
    
[Aethelstan] Uhtred!    
Aethelstan!    
Bastard?    
Aethelstan!    
    
[Uhtred] Aethelstan!    
[Aethelstan] Uhtred!    
    
    
    
[Osferth] Bastard! Where are you?    
[Uhtred] How many men?    
 There were three.
One escaped.    
[Finan] No sign this way.
Who were they?    
Not from here.    
Are you hurt?
 No.    
You took three men... alone?    
Yes.     
[Osferth] What did I say?    
    
I told you!    
Let me go downriver
and fight the sea raiders.    
No. You're not ready.    
Take him to the alehouse.
Celebrate his victory.    
[Sihtric] You had us worried there
for a second, boy.    
    
Just a scratch. Come on!    
    
[Osferth] Tonight we dine in Rumcofa.
You're the one not ready.    
[Finan] He's still a virgin though!    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
 He will redeem us all!    
You must follow. You must read this.    
We will all perish. We will all perish.    
God! There is one God!    
You, lady, redeem your heathen forebears.    
Return Jorvik to its Christian heart!    
Restore the name of Eoferwic.    
 Danes, hear me!    
There is only one God.    
How long can they do this?    
Every day the same sermon.    
King Edward pays them well.    
King Edward steals your people from you.
You are ruler here. Tell them to leave.    
And signal that it troubles us?    
A worthless fight.     
If I am to be provoked, it will take more
than an old man trying to extract coin.    
They're not just raising coin.
They poke at our gods.    
Our gods can withstand it.    
He's taking your kingdom
one convert at a time.    
We're supposed to be at peace.    
Yes and the peace means
that we are breeding at twice their speed.    
We grow our town.
We build a country for generations.    
We ignore old men.    
Could we not have them beaten,
just for good measure?    
 Maybe.
Once they've collected enough silver.    
They hide it in the sewers.    
Think we do not know.    
You accept too much.    
And you too little, my Queen.
    
Come on, Christian, fight me!    
Not all Danes want to keep the peace.    
Fight me!    
Did Jesus cut your cock off, hm? Fight me!    
[Sigtryggr] Is that my brother Rognvaldr?
Back from the dead. Once again.    
King Sigtryggr!    
Show yourself!    
The Great Raider Rognvaldr!
Who have you enraged this time?    
No one!    
I am completely reformed!    
A man of peace.    
We heard you drowned off Scotland.    
That was last year!    
I heard you needed a kick in the arse.    
Letting Christians roam your lands?    
Ignore them. They are harmless.    
Am I welcome?    
I will warn the serving women.    
You're welcome.    
    
 Jesus loves you!    
Wolland!    
Did you miss me?    
Let's get him to bed.
Prepare the chamber with no fire.    
That should keep his visit short.
Bring him in!    
Why has he come back now?    
Hella, if he tries anything this time,
I will cut his hands off myself.    
Thank you, Lady. You are good to us.    
    
Make it known that there will be a curfew    
until the visit
of the Lady of Mercia is over.    
Lord, it is Blood Month.    
Yes, they will have to hump each other
in daylight.    
Why the caution? They were just
sea raiders trying their luck upriver.    
They could have attacked anyone.
But they did not.    
They chose the eldest son
of the King of Wessex.    
Who actually knows that? Up here,
he's more arseling than aetheling.    
Perhaps.    
Perhaps they were just raiders
in search of coin, perhaps not.    
There've been signs. The air has changed.    
Well, that is definitely a bad sign.    
Yes. When Aethelflaed
comes for the festival,    
she's bringing us a priest,
a Father Benedict.    
Lodge them near the cornfield, show them
the East Well, and hide the strong ale.    
[Sihtric]    
But it's the festival.    
[Uhtred] She thinks Rumcofa
shames Mercia with its heathen ways.    
Uhtred! A ship, it's turned in
from the sea, which we cannot identify.    
Then the soldiers will be ready.    
Why would anyone attack
before the lady arrives?    
Line the riverbank. Prepare.    
Whoa.    
[Finan] Right, come on. Move.    
It's Rognvaldr come to slaughter.    
Will you stop?
You'll unsettle all the men.    
Rognvaldr is nothing.    
He's just a coward who buys reputation.
Trust us. We've fought a lot of Danes.    
Am I mistaken, or is that Eadith?    
[Eadith] We are travelers and traders!
Happy to pay the toll!    
    
[Sihtric] Hindr. Look after your sister.
    
[Sihtric] Hey, hey,
don't let the chickens run away.    
You remember Osferth.    
[Eadith] Yes.    
And that little one is Aethelstan.    
Surely not!    
Oh, you were a very solemn child.    
Yes, he beat it out of me.
 Thank you.    
Cynlaef.
Those two are always up to no good.    
[Sihtric] Go and annoy Uncle Finan.
Sidgeflaed, who's married to Sihtric.    
Hello.
Just call me Sig.     
[Uhtred] And all the little Sigs
and Sihtrics that populate this town.    
Oh, my God.
And this is Ingrith.    
Finan's wife.    
Eadith.
I have heard of you.    
What brings you to Rumcofa?    
I have learned much in Frankia
in the ways of healing.    
And I hear Rumcofa
is riddled with disease.    
Oh, that's all Osferth's work.    
    
So, uh, no husband, then?    
No. No, my silver's all my own.    
Hey, I'd watch yourself.    
Our turds have baffled every healer
from here to Frisia.    
You're telling me!    
[Finan] Hey! [blowing raspberries]
    
[Finan] Not on your child!    
Eadith, tell me, what were they like
before we civilized them?    
Much the same. This one less so perhaps.    
Is the king really happy with his son
living among soldiers?    
We tend not to mention that.    
No shame in being a bastard boy.
[Aethelstan] Whoa!    
Yes, much has changed.    
No. Uhtred's still the same.
What?    
He's not married either.    
    
Escort them to the lodging house.    
And do not get into any fights
with any young monks.    
    
It's not my reputation men wish to test.    
I trained you for battles,
not for ale yard brawls.    
 Look, I know you seek
to protect me.    
I know that, but you were sworn
to protect a child and I'm not.    
Yet I made a promise
to your father, the king.    
So, only a king can relieve me
of that oath.    
Our bond holds fast. Go.    
Pleasant surprise.    
[Uhtred] Hm?
Eadith.    
Though I'm wary of surprises
so close to Aethelflaed's visit.    
Eadith is a... friend.    
People can change.    
The attack on Aethelstan...
I do not think it was chance.    
Someone trying to get rid of him
now he's of age?    
Maybe just someone trying to frighten me.
And are you frightened?    
No. But I expect worse.    
Lord, you're brooding.    
My wife thinks it's the change
of the seasons getting to you.    
We have scouts at every lookout point
from here to the burh at Thelwall.    
Hey, hump the tall girl.    
    
Has he finally revealed what he wants?    
Not yet. He is still boasting
of his escape from the sea.    
He says the gods sent men to save him.
He always has a tale to tell.    
Do you know he pays sailors
to say they fear him?    
[Sigtryggr] Better a lying rogue
than a killer.    
You're too tender.    
Send him on his way.    
And break an oath of hospitality, my love?    
    
Wake up! You're in Valhalla!    
Wolland, get him to bed.    
    
Time for sleep.    
[Stiorra] Stop.
We do not want to see your arse.    
She's cold, your woman.    
We should set to feasting alone,
talk as kin.    
I have learned much since last I saw you.    
Changed myself.    
Things have happened to me.    
The gods chose to save me.    
We are never divided at feasting.    
We will feast, you and I.    
    
When you are sober, we will feast, hm?    
    
Why do you agree
when he seeks to come between us?    
[Sigtryggr] Stiorra.    
What he suffered,
when I left him alone in Irland...    
 ...you too would have
a spirit broken.    
He boasts because the gods
have not favored him.    
That doesn't mean you should.    
He is my brother and so I honor him.    
For all his faults, our blood is shared.    
 Blame the Christians.    
They have spoken too much of forgiveness.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
Uh...    
Oh, were you expecting a rather tall girl?    
Yes!    
She asked me to exchange rooms
because this bed was too short.    
That would explain it.
Yes. Ooh!    
    
    
    
    
    
[Aethelflaed] Keep at your right hand
the souls of kings.    
Alfred, known as the Wise,
and Aethelred of Mercia.    
Bless my daughter, Aelfwynn of Mercia.    
May she learn to resist temptation.    
I pray for my brother, the King of Wessex.    
Guide him well and hear my entreaty    
on behalf of my mother, Aelswith,
wife to Alfred.    
Why are you praying for me?
What do you think is wrong with me?    
I do not think anything
is wrong with you. I...    
Does it look white?
No, Mother, it looks quite normal.    
This breeze will stiffen my neck.
    
Lord knows what ailments
lurk within Rumcofa.    
Perhaps we should return to Aegelesburg?    
Uh, the Lord wants us
in Rumcofa for festival.    
Which Lord? Lord Uhtred?    
Do not fight her, it wastes your time.
    
Is something wrong with you?    
No, Mother. I am just stiff from riding.    
    
Lord Aldhelm, Father Benedict...    
Ready to bring the faith
to this dark corner of our land?    
Where you lead, we follow, Lady.    
    
 In you get!    
 Are these people
heading for Rumcofa?    
Blood Month is wild in these parts.    
That's why Lady Aethelflaed wants to find
a way to make it more Christian.    
Well, it falls near Martinmas.    
Perhaps we could enlighten them.
    
They would talk in Rome
of these Northern tribes    
that they could be resistant.    
Is the reputation deserved?    
The lady is fond of both you
and of Rumcofa.    
She will not place you
somewhere you would not thrive.    
Uhtred!    
Lady Aethelflaed is arriving.    
[Cynlaef] So, that's your cousin?
[Aethelstan]    
Yes. Go and help the Lady Aelfwynn
off her horse.    
Of course.    
Lady Aelfwynn, I'm Cynlaef.    
    
I was sorry to miss you
on our last visit south. I was...    
You were making a treaty
with the Scots, I know. Important.    
Yes, it was.    
Still, the timing was unfortunate.    
Not much has changed here in two summers.
The soldiers thrive, so does the town.    
Occasional raids, much trade.    
 
And you look well.
That's life in the open air.     
Perhaps I should try it.    
The Witan like to talk.
You still look beautiful.    
Behold our gift.    
[Uhtred] Rumcofa does not need a priest.    
No, but Father Benedict
needs a new place to preach.    
Did he hump someone?
No.    
No, nothing like that.
He's an exceptionally gifted scholar.    
He's a gambler.
He gambled all his alms money in Rome.    
Then in Canterbury. Then with us.
So put him where he can do no damage?    
Welcome to our chapel.    
    
Aethelflaed, look.
Look how fine he has become.    
Is he not the image of his father?    
You have the light of prayer
shining through you.    
And quite the swordsman now, I hear.    
Is it true you were attacked?    
 By raiders, yes, but I'm being
sent to fight them on the seas.    
No, he's not.    
Lady Aelswith, how's your stomach?    
I survive, but still, I should like us
to avoid too many commoners.    
For fear of passing them
my many afflictions.    
    
Aelfwynn!    
Lady Aelswith remains cautious
in matters of health.    
Lady Aelfwynn.
Lord Uhtred.     
Is the border secure?    
Yes. Aethelstan... was just thieves.    
Still, we're concerned.    
Uh, we've heard of a raider
plundering at sea, a Rognvaldr.    
Rognvaldr is not a threat.
He's a boastful turd.    
Ask his brother Sigtryggr.    
We will not be seeking
the word of Sigtryggr.    
Not concerning Danes on the border.
Why? The alliance has held.    
Uhtred, we know Sigtryggr
is family to you,    
but that does not mean
Mercia has to trust him.    
This Rognvaldr harries north of our coast.
We fear he may strike...    
Sigtryggr will not allow him to cause
real trouble. He extracts coin, no more.    
Tell that to the widows
of the men that we've lost.    
Thirty of them off the coast
of Cumbraland.    
Men massacred and not for silver,
but to avenge the gods, they said.    
I have to be more wary of the Dane.    
Heathen threat. I know many Danes
live here in Rumcofa in peace.    
Live in peace, trade, marry our men.    
The Danes are no danger here.
But this Dane is.    
Maybe we know things you do not.    
These past weeks,
there have been stories, mutilations.    
Raiders seen with white marking
on their faces.    
I do not think
that is the work of Rognvaldr.    
They may speak it of him,
but that does not make it true.    
Who then?    
    
We have received no word
of mourning from Rumcofa.    
 Yes. It did not quite work out.    
Does Aethelstan live?
He was a tough little bastard.    
Did you try?    
I lost two of my best men.    
Don't blame me.    
Blame Uhtred of Bebbanburg. If you have
the silver, I can try something else.    
I hear the lad can be provoked
into a scrap in an alehouse.    
Mm-mm. No.    
No, it's too soon.
I'll call on you when I'm ready.    
In the meantime, find out what is said    
among the common people
of my grandson Aelfweard?    
No one speaks of him, Lord.    
Then spread his name. For his protection.    
I have seen enough to know
that when two boys have one claim,    
both cannot thrive.    
Where am I next?    
The ambassadors
from the Duchy of Lotharingia.    
Oh.    
I can make an excuse, but you'd have
to meet a visionary from Lewes.    
She saw St. Cuthbert in a cabbage patch.    
What? Ambassadors it is.    
[Edward] She looks like
she's hawking fishes in Cheap Street.    
[Aethelhelm] Lord King.    
The queen is playing matchmaker.    
She is keen that her sisters find husbands
that will do you honor, Lord King.    
[Edward] Mm.    
Will you be introducing them
to Aelfweard as the aetheling?    
And why would I do that?
My grandson is coming of age.    
It would signal abroad
that your dynasty is prepared.    
And alarm people
by mooting the succession.    
No, I'm still a young man myself.    
Aelfweard, introduce Lord Aethelhelm
to the guests on my behalf.    
Explain he is a respected elder
of the family.    
Yes, Father. Of course.    
I'm sure they'll love your stories
from the old days.    
Well, perhaps I should advise her
on making suitable alliances.    
Indeed. There's nothing worse than being
landed with a spouse you come to detest.    
    
Welcome.    
Please.    
[Aelflaed] My darling boy.    
Did you suggest that Aelfweard
be introduced as aetheling?    
Yes. Uh, he refused.    
And the other aspect of our plan
has become problematic.    
Aethelstan fought back.    
Of course.    
'Cause they are training him to become
a killer who will one day come for us.    
Calm yourself.    
All of Wessex
favors Aelfweard as aetheling.    
That will sway things if there is
any contention in the matter.    
[Aelflaed] For now the king looks more
to other women every day.    
Ah, I shall remove her.    
Like you removed Lady Aelswith?    
Lady Aelswith's...    
 ...strong constitution    
is a blessing to us all.     
My grandfather, Lord Aethelhelm.    
You have recovered.    
Indeed, and my regret if I broke
the conditions of my welcome.    
I am sworn from ale these days, but...    
...sometimes...    
What is it you want?    
Stiorra.    
He only visits when he wants something.
Make your demands and then leave us be.    
You are right. She sees everything.    
I seek safe harbor for some of my people.    
They have been accused of raiding
and, I believe, unfairly.    
I wish for them to prove
their innocence here, under Danelaw.    
And I have agreed.    
I will send out Wolland
with some guard to bring them in,    
ensure they cause no trouble.    
As you command, Lord.    
The Saxons always look for reasons
to make incursions.    
This will show them
that our borders must be respected    
and that we govern here
with justice under the law.    
Mm. And remind the Christians
you're not to be moved.    
And that we intend to rule here
for many years to come.    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
My lady, a dance?    
Why so troubled?    
I wish you had stayed in Aegelesburg.    
And miss Blood Month festival? Never.    
You did not come for the festival.    
What did you come for?
What is here that is not there?    
Some say I came to see you.    
I wish that were true,
but I think it is not.    
Is there a threat to you I should know?
No more than the usual.    
You're certain?    
Yes.
Besides, you have protected us well here.    
You have scouts on the bankside
and on every road.    
We would not lie about a threat
to me or to Rumcofa.    
 Ready?    
He's not going to say prayers, is he?
I just asked for a few simple words.    
And in this moment,
Rumcofa came under God!    
It may be harder than that
to douse the pagan flame.    
 ...virgin and mother,
for these pigs...    
...and these chickens, Gods!    
    
Make sure he gives that back.    
We pray for fertility, the rising of sun,
the waxing of the moon...    
 Why did he choose
the Lorica of Loding? 
We shall catch our deaths in this draft.    
Just smile and wait for it to pass.    
 ...defend me
on every side.    
Skull, head, hair and eyes,    
mouth, tongue...    
teeth and their covering.    
    
 Neck, breast, side.    
For the crown of my head with its hair,    
be thou the helmet of salvation
on the head.    
 Yes!    
For forehead, eyes, nostrils...    
bowels...    
    
Waist!    
 Oh, please.    
For my limbs, for my entrails,
thou mayest thrust back from me    
the invisible nails of stakes.    
Eyes, triform brain...    
nose, face, teeth, the chin...    
...beard, eyebrows, ears, cheeks.    
 Make way! Move!    
Stand back!    
 Who is it?    
    
 Who is it? Children, stay back.    
Father...    
 Help him!
Who did this to you? Rognvaldr?    
    
Brida.    
    
Find her. Find her.    
Raise the alarm... now!    
Son.    
My son.    
Lord Jesus Christ, in a rich man's house.    
A fallen woman cried
as she dried his feet...    
Why allow your people to be converted?    
Why not keep Daneland for Danes?
Is it because of your wife?    
Since when have you cared so much
for the gods?    
I told you, much has changed
this last year.    
I was close to death
and not for the first time.    
I am sorry that you suffered.
But this time, I was reborn.    
The gods sent men to my rescue.    
They took to a land of fire.    
And there I learnt how to be loyal
to them and to my people.    
But you do not care for loyalty.    
He blesses you and the Lord Jesus.    
[Sigtryggr] Have these missionaries sent
back to Wessex tomorrow. That's enough.    
 Lord, yes, Lord.    
 I... But I...
I speak here every night.    
We've always been allowed to preach here.    
 Strongest bow, sharpest spear  
 He who rules heaven and earth  
    
You are too accepting of enemies.    
No, I am not.    
It is more difficult to live peacefully
with enemies than to fight them.    
Do you pity me?    
I think you suffer without my guidance.    
    
That is Wolland.    
Show me those who follow you.
This can be resolved.    
    
 Strongest bow, sharpest spear 
    
 He who rules heaven and earth  
 My Lord!    
    
    
Sigtryggr!    
    
Sigtryggr!    
Open the gates.    
    
Are these your people?    
 What do you want?    
Not mine. Hers.    
[Rognvaldr] All Danes, all pure.    
Do not be afraid, brother.
She's here to save us.    
Where are my men?
    
 Where are my men?!    
 Valhalla!    
    
    
    
    
Danes of Jorvik who turned to Christ...    
we are here to return you to the gods!    
No, Lady, do not fight. Hide.    
    
    
[Brida] Where is she?    
Find Stiorra, find Uhtred's daughter.    
 Brida!    
We're ready for you!    
Brida!    
[Uhtred] Brida!

SEASON: 03
EPISODE: 09
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred. 
After rightfully killing
a turbulent priest, 
I made my escape
by threat the life of the king. 
I am now an outlaw
and banished from Winchester. 
Alfred is dying, 
and to secure the position
of his son Edward as his heir, 
he has arranged a marriage. 
In his own desire for the crown, 
Aethelwold has been found
guilty of treason. 
The punishment is blinding.   
   
Does the challenge to Edward
begin here or not?   
Edward cannot succeed.   
 The Danes
Aethelwold did side with 
await Alfred's imminent death
before marching against Wessex. 
We have swords in hand
and a battle ahead of us!   
   
 I have returned
to Winchester in secret, 
to seek help for my sister Thyra. 
Ragnar's trapped in Niflheim.
Only your blood can save him now.   
 Surround the house.
Do it now. 
 Wessex is in greater turmoil
than ever before, 
and terror fills the
hearts of the people. 
 My own wife
has dug out a hiding hole. 
In fear of her life. 
She has been threat by who?   
By people who themselves are afraid
of life without their king.   
Uhtred is here. 
You can have him executed,
or you can speak with him. 
 And so I find myself waiting
for a king at the end of his days. 
Destiny is all. 
 It is a chronicle.   
The pages.   
It is a chronicle of Wessex.   
It will include my life as king...   
from the moment
of my brother's death until now.   
Songs of a kind.   
None of which will mention
Uhtred of Bebbanburg.   
Men will remember what I have done.   
But men will die, as we all must.   
These pages will remain.   
The act of committing ink to parchment
gives a deed permanence.   
If it is not burned.   
If it is preserved, yes.   
And in one hundred years from now,   
learned people will read
or recite what is written,   
and Alfred will appear.   
They will know
nothing of the Lord Uhtred...   
nor of your...   
loyalty...   
advice...   
bravery...   
courage...   
and insolence.   
Why are you here?   
In Winchester?   
In this room.   
I was told you wished to speak.   
Why grant me that wish?
What is it you want from me?   
What is it you would say to me,
while I am still able to listen?   
If I were to say one thing,   
it would be that I could
never have killed you.   
When I held the knife to your throat,   
I could never have taken your life.   
I would have beaten you, gladly.   
But I would never be the man
who killed Alfred, King of Saxons.   
killing me would have earned you
a place in these pages.   
I would not want such a deed written.   
Besides, I've earned my place
in these pages.   
But every lord is the hero
of his own songs.   
I understand my absence.   
It will not be written that Alfred
did stand on Uhtred's shoulders.   
Many times.   
But I know it to be true.   
Thank you, Lord.   
   
Do you believe I could end your life?
You are an outlaw.   
It would be written that Alfred,
frail and sick,   
did find the strength to slay
the warrior Uhtred Ragnarson.   
That will not happen.
Because I lack the will?   
Because we are bonded.   
You cannot kill me,
just as I cannot kill you.   
   
   
My sword is heavy.   
I must sit.   
There is wine in the jug,
if you would pour it.   
For Edward and his bride.
May they be well.   
May God protect them.   
I say "may God protect them,"
but God often works through men.   
He has worked through you in the past.
I know it.   
No man alone could break
the shield wall as you did at Ethandun.   
I am heathen, Lord.   
You are baptized.
I believe in the old gods.   
 The devil, too,
works through men.   
My death will bring
the devil in some men to the fore.   
Even good men will be tempted
by greed, power, glory, even.   
Christian men?
Ah, yes.   
They sit in my hall as we speak. 
They eat my food,
they drink my wine and ale, 
and they raise a cup to the happy pair. 
    
May God help them.    
    
    
Very well. Good.    
Lord Aethelhelm.    
May I congratulate you on your new status    
as father-in-law to an aetheling.    
Should you not cover that wound?
I find it ugly, off-putting.    
Oh, you refer to my eye?    
I see it as a reminder
of my loyalty to the Crown,    
wherever the crown may eventually rest.    
The crown will rest on Edward's head.    
Mmm, with luck,
but that is just one possibility.    
Witans and ealdormen are
unpredictable beasts    
and we are in uncertain times.    
I hope that you are drunk.
You are certainly offensive.    
You are not Edward's first father-in-law.    
He claims his bastard children
to be legitimate.    
Edward has been married once before,
but only the once.    
If the bastards were not bastards,
I would know.    
 You should have been told
as you are a most powerful ally.    
The children are the result of wild oats.    
They are the result of oats sown in love.    
Edward's choice of words, apparently.    
 Lord, I am to remind you
that your place is not at this table.    
Agreed, Steapa.
My rightful place is not at this table.    
It has been a pleasure
speaking with you, Lord.    
Pardon my eye, or, rather, its absence.    
There's a sense of unrest
about Winchester.    
There is a sense of unrest at this table.    
Aldhelm, have a messenger
return to Mercia.    
I would like the comfort
of further hearth-guards.    
That is not necessary, not at all.    
Your father could be lying dead
as we speak and then what would happen?    
Aldhelm, the messenger.    
Yes, Lord.    
The king is where, Beocca? His chamber?    
He is resting, Lady. That is all I know.    
I shall find him.    
He did appear exhausted, Lady.    
He never tires of his wife. Never.    
You should mention to Lord Aethelhelm    
that you fear Uhtred Ragnarson is nearby.    
We do not know if that is true.
Of course it is true.    
If his men are here, Uhtred is here.    
He is here for revenge.    
That is the truth
we shall continue to tell.    
Lord, I would like to understand    
why you brought my
children to Winchester...    
and why you saw fit to
have them baptized.    
It was done to damn you.    
To inflict pain, possibly.    
I try to make decisions rationally.    
However, taking your children
was not a rational decision.    
It was thoughtless. It was selfish.    
They have been treated well.    
And you are not the best of fathers.    
I was not allowed to be their father.
I'm banished.    
You killed a man inside this palace.    
Though I admit, there was provocation.    
And I was wrong in both my judgment
and my punishment.    
I did not give you the respect
nor trust that you deserved.    
I was afraid.    
I am afraid.    
Not of you, not of death...    
but of losing everything
that Wessex has become,    
everything that is written here
in these pages.    
My work must continue.    
This land must grow.    
An England must emerge
and God must be praised.    
We are and we remain
the last true Saxon kingdom.    
We cannot go on building walls
between the tribes.    
Similarly, we cannot be overrun.    
That would render my time as worthless.    
My father's time, my brothers' time,
it would have all have been wasted.    
Lord.    
I was told you were resting.    
Why is he here?    
Uhtred is here at my invitation.    
You did say that if he were
to set foot in Wessex once more,    
he would be executed.    
And now I have other words to say.    
If you would leave us,    
and if you would say nothing of Uhtred
to our guests, to any man?    
I don't understand why you invite
our enemies to eat at our table.    
First Aethelwold, and now him.    
Lady.    
Lord King, there must be
no more forgiveness.    
It makes you appear weak.    
My dear, you have been invited
to leave us.    
And you will do what?
Ask him to stand at Edward's side?    
I will decline.    
I will not have it!    
Aelswith, you will leave us.    
    
She is angry because I am dying.    
And that does not make her heartless.
It is her heart that is hurting.    
    
Like me...    
like many in Wessex perhaps...    
my wife is afraid...    
of this.    
Of what will be written from this day on.    
The uncertainty of what comes next.    
What comes next, Lord, is life.
It continues. It always will.    
But in which direction? Who will reign?
Which God will be praised?    
Which language spoken?
What laws will prevail?    
You have had your time.
Soon it will be the turn of others.    
God, or the gods...    
they will decide.    
Agreed.    
    
But...    
my last act, for my God,    
must be to ensure
that good men hold power.    
That is what I must do.    
And that is why you are here,
in this room.    
 You will not
rush off immediately,    
but I would like guards placed
in every corridor of the palace.    
The outlaw Uhtred is here.    
He is to leave the palace immediately
after leaving the king.    
He'll be dealt with in the days to come.
Yes, Lady.    
 Mother...    
you seem concerned.    
Is it the king?    
No.    
No.    
It is the worry of a celebration,
nothing more.    
Soon they will all be drunk and vomiting.    
I shall be able to breathe then.    
And the truth is what?    
The truth is we are living in different
and dangerous times.    
You will need all of your resolve.    
Smile.    
 It seems just yesterday...    
that I gave Edward over to you
as a dying infant.    
I feared my prayers had
not been answered,    
and I gave him to you...    
and to Iseult.    
You remember her.    
Always.    
Uhtred...    
I wish to give over to you my son,
for a second time,    
and for the same reason as the first.
To ensure he lives.    
Say nothing. Say nothing. Not yet.    
All I ask is that you remain in
Winchester until he is crowned king.    
Then you can do as you please.    
You can go north.
You can reclaim your lands.    
I am an outlaw, Lord.    
No longer.    
You are hereby...    
pardoned.    
On condition I agree to remain
in Winchester?    
You are pardoned
regardless of your decision.    
And if beyond that door my wife
has summoned guards, which is likely,    
I will dismiss them.    
I have made my peace.    
I have made my request.
I do not require an answer.    
Thank you, Lord...    
for correcting your mistake.    
I should have closed my eyes    
and rattled at Heaven's
gates some time ago.    
It was the hope of this meeting
that has kept me alive.    
To Uhtred, the true Lord of Bebbanburg...    
a man I have never understood,
but without whom I would not die a king.    
    
 Go away!
 Lord, it is Aldhelm.    
 What?    
What?    
Lord, I did not dispatch the messenger.    
To summon further guards?    
We have a good number of men here,    
and sending for more
could suggest aggression, I feel.    
You're saying you disobeyed me?    
I am giving you counsel, Lord.
Why bring men south now,    
when the Danes must be readying
themselves for battle...    
You were disobeying me.
Do not dare dress it as counsel.    
It is becoming a habit, I have noticed.    
As I've noticed your soft eyes
for my wife.    
It is counsel, Lord.    
Do not fall under her spell.    
Bed her, yes,
and give me the satisfaction of divorce,    
but do not dare love her!    
On the day that Alfred dies,
I shall become King of Mercia,    
that very day.    
And I shall announce it
here in Winchester.    
That is not aggression, that is fact.    
You will send for further guards,
   or more, immediately.    
You should be under furs, woman, with me.    
    
war is near and I want to enjoy
all of you while there's time.    
    
You sent Aethelwold to kill Uhtred.    
You must have some belief in him.    
I sent him to Winchester to sow unrest
and to raise an army of Saxons,    
and if the chance arises, kill Uhtred.    
Men are saying freely
it was him who killed Ragnar.    
Aethelwold? You believe that?    
Is it true?
Come to bed. Lie with me.    
Answer me truthfully. Was it him?    
Truthfully, I do not know.
    
But for now, I need Aethelwold alive.    
Once he has served his purpose,
I will kill him.    
Was it him?    
He was in fear of Ragnar.
That is all I know.    
Then he's mine to kill.    
Only mine.    
When battle comes, he must be protected.    
He's mine.
Very well.    
I'm cold.
Then go to bed.    
I'll follow.    
    
Dane.    
Say it.
    
Say you're a Dane.    
 Dane whore. Say it.    
Say it!    
I am proud to be a Dane
and to be the wife of a Saxon priest.    
I am of two peoples.    
"I am of two peoples."
That doesn't make sense.    
I wish to live in peace.    
You are a Dane... and nothing more.    
You will let her pass
or I will have your balls.    
Thyra, my apologies.
Tidman's head is hollow.    
My head is fine.
Yes, it would make a fine bucket.    
It was a game.    
If you wish to torment her,
then do it where you cannot be seen.    
It was a game.    
    
 Uhtred has been pardoned.
He is in Winchester?    
Did I not say I could smell him?
What now?    
He cannot be allowed
to ally himself to Edward.    
One, or preferably both
of them, must die.    
Edward would be easier to kill.    
Outside. Outside, all of you!    
Could you not keep
control of your tongue?    
What you speak of is treachery!    
No, it is not treachery, it is the way.
Edward dies, I claim the crown,    
we survive the Danes
and Lord Sigebriht counts his silver.    
Above all, we survive.    
What is required now
is for Alfred to roll over and die.    
 It may be months
before Edward's king.    
By then the Danes will be marching.    
Alfred will be gone much sooner
even than one month. It will be days.    
Then there's the argument,
for want of a better word.    
Edward is not
every Saxon's choice for king.    
 Judging by the cackle
in the alehouse,    
Edward is not any man's choice.
 Men are saying what?    
 Edward looks
like a woman's arse    
and you are here to kill him.    
 News of your pardon
will change what people say. Thyra?    
Thyra... what is it?    
Why the tears?    
 Maybe you should let me
speak to this man.    
I'm quite capable. She's my wife.    
Yes, but you have a temper.
I do, and it's up.    
Tidman!
I'm looking for a rat named Tidman!    
Are you Tidman?    
I asked, "Are you Tidman?"
Father Beocca, good morning.    
And Uhtred, free man of Wessex.    
I'm looking for a man named Tidman.
Does the coward belong to you?    
He does not.
I am not a coward.    
What is it you want, priest?    
What I want, oaf,
is for you to heed my warning.    
Speak to or go near my wife again
and I shall beat the shit from you!    
 Oh, well said.
It is a promise.    
I called your woman a Dane.
Is that... is that not what she is?    
Have you not understood me?    
You don't appear to be
the cleverest of men.    
Do you speak to me as a man or a priest?
    
Does that answer your question?
Does that answer your question?    
I do not hide beneath these robes!
 Beocca, enough! No more!    
Bastard! She's a woman!    
A gentle woman, and
she's suffered enough!    
I'm warning you once!    
I'm calm. I am calm now.    
 Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey! Hey!    
 I'm calm.    
This rotten air that fills Winchester    
is due to you and the likes of you.    
England is a land for all tribes
who wish to settle and live in peace.    
Your father would be ashamed of you.    
 Go with him.    
I fear the priest does not like me.    
No man likes you, Aethelwold.
Your soul is as scarred as your face.    
Courtesy of my Uncle Alfred in his mercy.    
Why are you here?
Do you still dream you can be king?    
It is my home and I will not move.    
This is a land I love.
Can you say the same?    
Ah, Uhtred, I am tired of listening
to this squirrel's arse.    
Let me offer you a cup of ale.    
Come inside and sit with me.
Let me convince you I am for Wessex.    
Hear me.    
Please.    
Lord Uhtred.    
 Lord Sigebriht.    
You stand with Aethelwold?    
 Sigebriht has his own mind.
I stand for a strong Wessex.    
Where exactly do you stand, Lord,
may I ask?    
Is it with Edward?    
You say it as though
there are men against Edward.    
There are men who doubt him, yes.    
But if Uhtred were to stand
alongside him...    
I was at Ethandun.
I stood beside you in a shield wall.    
He is barely a man.    
And Alfred could barely lift
a sword above his head,    
yet he was a man to follow.    
I say again, Edward is not Alfred.
He is not a man to follow.    
The Danes know this.
You're still with them. Admit it.    
 I am for Wessex.    
Lord, you did not answer my question.
Where does Uhtred stand?    
If he is to stand with Edward, what then?    
I have said. They must die.    
    
I know this is an inopportune moment,
but I must ask.    
Why was I not told that Edward
had been married previously?    
That his children were born
in this marriage?    
Do these children have standing at all?    
You were not told, Lord,
because it is unimportant.    
The marriage is the past.    
The children are bastards,
I can assure you.    
Would it not be simpler...    
if these children also did not exist?    
For Edward and the
children that may come.    
Perhaps if...    
if they were truly
nothing more than rumor?    
Something to ponder.    
If you would excuse me.    
I struggle to understand
the king's thinking.    
Why he panders to you is beyond me.    
You neither appreciate his trust,
nor deserve it.    
The king is a clever man.    
You are not.    
Lord...    
I am not an enemy of the king.    
Even if that were true, what you are
is a most dangerous ally.    
With Alfred that might be acceptable.    
He is more than your equal.    
But Edward is not.    
And I, for one, shall do my utmost    
to keep you as far away
from the boy as possible.    
Thank you, Lord.
That would be most appreciated.    
Childish...    
and reckless.    
I have been told, by Aelswith no less,    
that you are not to wander
the palace corridors without a guard.    
Say it.    
Whatever's on your mind.
I have no place.    
I'm not a husband.
I am not Uhtred of Coccham,    
not Uhtred of Bebbanburg.    
I'm not Uhtred Ragnarson.    
I am not even an outlaw anymore.    
I would say you're each
and all of those men.    
Especially the outlaw,
as you'll never conform.     
You'll only follow what you truly
believe, and that is no bad thing.    
The only thing you're not is cursed.    
You're a free man. Your path is your own.    
You have a choice to make, Uhtred.
That is all.    
Then I choose you as my greatest friend.    
You are an abbess and a warrior.
True.    
And have I ever mentioned that
you are too good a woman for God alone?    
 Once or twice.
That is true.    
The abbess has me shackled, Lady.
I'm her prisoner.    
Abbess Hild, be sure to wash your hands.    
Winchester is a better place
when you are here.    
Know that much.    
    
    
 Cnut! Cnut!    
Put an end to this before
someone picks up a sword.    
Just a little while longer.
They need the taste of blood.    
They need use of their limbs.    
We need them to fight the Saxons!    
Which will be soon, Haesten, my friend.    
I can feel it. I can feel it in my balls!    
    
 Come here! Come here!    
 Lord King.    
    
 Uhtred.    
Are you here or is it my sickness?    
I wish to tell you
that I will remain in Winchester    
until Edward is crowned king.    
I swear.    
    
 I intend to show Lord
Aethelhelm the chronicle this evening.    
Do you agree?    
I do.    
Invest him in the history of Wessex.    
Bind him and his wealth.    
Yes.    
I have asked Edward to attend,
and his bride.    
Lord, forgive me, but there is one matter
that concerns me greatly.    
I cannot remain silent.    
Uhtred.    
What you have done is wrong.    
By pardoning the outlaw,    
you have opened the door to him
becoming Edward's advisor.    
I know this is your intention,
but it is wrong.    
Necessary.    
It is not.    
For England, it is necessary.    
 Edward cannot be God's king    
and England cannot be God's country,    
if it is a pagan who guides him and us.    
Why are the Danes forever at our door?    
Because we are being punished, Lord,
for the presence of this heathen.    
He is for England.    
 He is an outlaw.    
 My England...    
my love.    
 He is an outlaw.
He must be treated as such.    
I will not go against you, Lord.
I could not.    
And so I ask you,
rescind what you have done.    
Lord King...    
    
    
 Who is it?    
It is me, Father Beocca.    
 He is with God now.    
Of that there can be no doubt.
My king is with his God.    
He cannot be gone.
His work is not finished.    
Where is England?
Where is the one united land?    
That was his purpose.
He has work unfinished.    
He cannot be gone. God
would not allow it.    
He will have been comforted that you
were with him, Lady, at the last.    
You know of his death,    
and I will tell his children,    
but that is all.    
I do not feel able...    
He was loved by the people.    
They will want to grieve.    
His people must be told.    
I'm afraid.    
He's gone.    
 But his spirit is within us.    
We must pray to God
for his help and guidance.    
And as Alfred is with God,
he will ensure that we are heard.    
He was sickly...    
but he was here.    
 And now he is not.    
I shall...
I shall fetch his children myself.    
    
    
I loved you, Lord King.    
Heaven shall be your reward.    
And I pray that one day...    
we shall meet again.    
    
I did not love him for quite some time.    
As a young man, he
behaved as a young man.    
I could not forgive him.    
And then, without being aware of why,    
I realized that I did love him,
with all my heart and mind.    
I saw that he needed me.    
I knew that without me he could not
be the king that God demanded.    
He has visited the Holy Father, in Rome.    
Did you know?    
I did.    
He was a child then... a baby.    
A life passes so quickly.    
Edward, you shall fetch Father Beocca.    
We shall prepare for the first day
in a new land.    
 Father Beocca, 
my husband appreciated your loyalty,
advice and your faith in him.    
 A privilege.    
 You have
my most sincere thanks.    
 An honor, Lady.    
Alfred is gone.    
You were the king's priest,
and as such, you no longer have a role.    
Bishop Erkenwald has agreed
that you may speak at the king's service,    
but that must be your final duty
within the palace.    
You are bonded with heathens,
Father Beocca.    
Edward must be God's king.
Bishop Erkenwald agrees.    
Which heathens would they be, Lady?    
My wife's Christian. She's been baptized.    
You are, and you shall always be,
a protector of Uhtred.    
Uhtred does not need my protection.    
You are bonded with heathens.    
Edward must look to God and only to God.    
You will tell your friend Uhtred
that his pardon is to be rescinded.    
But the letter is written
in the king's hand.    
He must leave Winchester
or I shall have him taken.    
A man cannot threat to kill a king
and go unpunished.    
 Lady!    
For my part, I do not care if I serve God
in the palace of Winchester    
or the middle of a barren field.    
But in rescinding a royal pardon,
I fear you're making a mistake.    
The Danes will hear about it
and it will embolden them.    
And your son Edward
is not yet a commander.    
If God is with us, then we shall win.    
I will not leave Winchester, I cannot.    
You can and you must.
Not until Edward is king.    
You promised Alfred this?    
I did.    
 If the pardon does not hold,    
then you cannot stay
and wait to be imprisoned and killed.    
 Where should he go?    
Anywhere a horse can take him.
Anywhere a ship can go.    
Uhtred came here for a reason.
He came for Ragnar's blood.    
He has a task to fulfill.    
The blood must be kept safe.    
A battle is coming.
You must choose a side.    
The problem being
is neither side wants him.    
    
Which is a further reason
why you must stay. Wait for Edward.    
Which is why Alfred asked you
for what seemed a simple promise.    
Bastard thinks.    
He knows your honor, Uhtred. That is all.    
    
You should not be here, Dane.    
 The king is dead.    
So together we pray for his soul,
and for his successor, Edward.    
May God guide and protect him always.    
May God surround him
with strength and wisdom.    
Amen.
 Amen.    
    
 Lord, I have orders to kill you,    
should you not leave the hall quietly.    
    
 Steapa, what is this?
Hmm? What is this?    
Finan, do nothing.    
He's a free man.    
    
Do not think I am afraid of you.    
    
    
    
 Are you rejoicing
at the king's death, bitch?    
That is where you belong,
in a hole, in the ground.    
    
    
    
    
 Beocca!    
Help! Help me!    
Beocca!    
Please!

SEASON: 03
EPISODE: 08
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred. 
My brother, Ragnar,
died not as a warrior, 
but was murder in his bed. 
He cannot enter the hall of the gods. 
He will spend eternity
in the cold of Niflheim because of you.  
You will wet the blade
with Ragnar's blood.  
Only that way will he be free
to enter Valhalla.  
Might his blood be in others?  
Thyra?   
 Skade has me tortured.
I cannot resist her. 
Your path is the path I choose for you,
Uhtred Ragnarson.   
Your spirit is mine to torment.   
 And although
I have now taken her from Haesten, 
her curse still holds me. 
She has invade my heart and my mind. 
She is poison to all men.   
How do you kill a curse?   
Without breaking the skin
or shedding one drop of blood.   
And you've got to do the same to Skade.   
 In Winchester, a political union
has been arranged for Edward. 
But he has loved and abandoned another. 
I am married to Ecgwynn.   
Your wife will be dealt with.   
 You're Ecgwynn.
I'm confiscating the children.   
They shall belong to the church
and dedicate their lives to God.   
 Edward has a jealous enemy,
Lord Sigebriht, 
who wanted his secret wife, Ecgwynn,
for himself. 
She is confined to a nunnery.   
I would understand it entirely
if you could not serve Edward.   
 Under his
Danish masters' orders, 
Aethelwold has returned to Wessex. 
I wish to speak to the king.   
 But his treason is known
to the dying Alfred. 
Aethelwold's failings
were born from my own.   
My brother, who I loved,
who am I to take his son's life?   
The punishment...   
is blinding.   
   
 Destiny is all. 
   
Trust me.   
   
I have seen the rebirth
of Uhtred Ragnarson.   
I have seen    men become    
and then  ,   ,   
with more joining him by the day.   
And I have seen Alfred fall at last
and Uhtred rise.   
Taste me.   
May I say what an honor it is has been   
to ride alongside the Lady of Mercia.   
Does it trouble you so much, Lord,
that your wife is respected?   
If not respectable.   
There'll be plenty of ale
and wine at this wedding.   
I suggest you refrain.   
You do not like me enjoying myself?   
I do not like you drunk.   
Perhaps this wedding
will be followed by a funeral.   
A sobering enough thought.   
May I ask, Father Beocca, how is he?   
How is our king?   
He is prepared for whatever may come.   
Both Alfred and Edward
are in my prayers daily...   
nightly.   
It must be a worrying time
for you, Father.   
What becomes of the king's advisor
when the king is no more?   
I, too, am prepared.
And to have no influence.   
Does not concern me.
No protection.   
I have God. He is all I need.   
And you have a wife, Father.   
Do not forget your wife...   
of strong, Dane stock.   
Why am I not surprised
to hear you threat a woman?   
Father Beocca, please,
forgive me my sins.   
I shall leave you to your prayers.   
If indeed that is what you are here for.   
 I shall watch out for you,
Father Beocca,   
with my good eye.   
I'd rather we meet at the alehouse.   
Father Beocca is already imagining
a conspiracy.   
Because he is afraid.   
Like the whole of Wessex is afraid.   
The king is dying
and a child is about to take his place.   
What are your thoughts on the matter?   
The matter of Edward?
Becoming king.   
It is the purpose of the witan
to choose a king.   
It is.   
Yet Alfred would have us
refer to him as Edward Rex.   
   
Men are saying that Uhtred
is in Edward's debt.   
That Uhtred will reappear
and swear an oath to Edward...   
Then we must instruct other men
to say otherwise!   
I will pay them if needs must,   
but we cannot allow
Edward's reputation to grow.   
"We"?   
Are we of the same mind or not?   
Are we prepared to act or not?   
Does the challenge to Edward
begin here or not?   
It does.   
It does. Edward cannot succeed.    
So, these are the facts of the matter.    
Uhtred blames Alfred for his banishment    
and for the loss of his land and wealth.    
Alfred is near death. Uhtred will,
therefore, take his revenge upon Edward.    
Uhtred Ragnarson,
which is how he now wishes to be known,    
wants Wessex for the Danes.    
That's the news our men shall repeat,
and repeat and repeat    
until it becomes the absolute truth.    
Uhtred cannot be allowed
to ally himself to Edward.    
Ever.
I understand.    
Right now, it's you and
I against the boy,    
but only because Alfred lives.    
The very instant he dies,
then fear and doubt will grow.    
The people will not wish their fate    
to be in the hands of
a smooth-faced child.    
We must be ready.    
We must be ready.    
And we must be ruthless.    
 Is the idea we walk into Coccham
like we've never been away?    
Yes.
Directly to the hall?    
Yes.
And if another lord resides there?    
We ask him to leave, my friend.
I can do that.    
Are we to expect a wedding, Lord?    
We did not risk our lives
for you to hump the bitch.    
Do you plan to kill her with your cock?
I plan to see my children.    
Lord... you will not remember me.    
I remember. You're Edwin.
You're married to Mildwynn.    
Lord, they have taken more
than half our winter's store.    
Animals and grain.    
They say it is to feed Alfred's army,
but we will certainly starve.    
Who did this?
They're at the hall, Lord.    
Alfred would not have ordered this!    
 Stand aside.
I want no blood shed, no man killed.    
He said stand aside! Now!    
Thank you.
I should not need to raise my voice.    
Uhtred?    
Uh, what is the meaning of this invasion?    
This is my home.    
We are here by right,
on the king's business.    
You are stealing food
from the mouths of the poor.    
An army needs to be fed.    
As do priests, it seems.    
You're lucky it's not your hand.    
We want no disharmony here today.    
 What is that?    
Well, you know what it is.    
Take it down.    
Take it down
or I will make a gift of you to Skade.    
I will not do as you ask.    
I cannot.    
Lord, see it as a piece of wood,
nothing more.    
It is a holy cross.    
Bishop Erkenwald, shut your holy mouth.    
And take it down.    
Or I... I can just take it down, Lord.    
 You will do nothing.    
I realize you are looking to
find a reason to kill me,    
and I would prefer to do as you ask.    
I'm not a fool,
but I cannot deny my faith.    
The king will hear of it.
God would know of...    
The king has told me many times
that this is a pagan's hall.    
You will take it down.    
 It is my cross, Lord.    
My doing. I put it there.
And I would like it to remain there,    
unless of course, your plan
is to once again be the Lord of Coccham.    
I meant no insult.    
    
Now, perhaps, we may eat.    
You may take it.    
When you leave, you will
take only half the grain    
of what you have gathered.    
I understand an army must be fed,
but my village will not starve.    
The king will not approve.    
The king is a ghost...    
nothing more than that.    
Lord, may we speak further, privately?    
Good to see you, Lord.
And you, Abbess Hild.    
Should you be here?
I came to see my children.    
Do not react, do not revolt.    
Your children are fine. They're not here.
They're at Winchester.    
With Thyra?    
Under the Crown's care. Good care.    
The Crown?
They are well. I swear it.    
They can't be in the care
of nuns and priests.    
They're well and happy.
I have seen it. You have been absent.    
If Alfred is not already dead,
I will kill him.    
He does this to damn me further?
He does not.    
Have they been made Christian? Baptized?    
It will do them no harm...
He has no right!    
He has done this to damn me
and to damn my wife!    
Lord, you, too, should eat.    
Later.    
You should eat now, my love.
I said later.    
As you wish.    
She's your woman now?    
A man needs a woman.
You replace Gisela with her?    
Who I bed is no business of an abbess.    
I am speaking as a friend.    
It's good to see you're well.
Back to your usual self, in fact.    
Hild...
    
I have been absent.    
I would like to see my children
at Winchester.    
Can you help?    
Yes, I can help you.
Of course I can help you.    
But Bishop Erkenwald will tell
of your visit here in Wessex.    
They'll be watching for you.    
You look thin.    
You should eat, my love.    
Finan.
Lord?    
Have the priests unload
half of what they've taken.    
Send them back to Alfred.
You will ride with them.    
All the way to Winchester?
I will follow and find you.    
And what of Skade?
She stays with me.    
I will find you in Winchester.
I must be there. Unseen.    
And if Alfred decides to take me hostage?    
He will have you watched, nothing more.    
You need only drink ale and find a woman.    
I can do that.    
We all need a good woman!    
Father Beocca!    
Father, there is talk
that your friend, Uhtred,    
has sworn revenge against Alfred.    
Revenge? For what?
Being outcast.    
And should Alfred die,
they say he will kill Edward.    
That is nonsense. Who is saying this?    
It does not sound like a nonsense to me,
Father, nor to the men here.    
Uhtred fought shoulder to shoulder
with Edward. You were there, Lord.    
I was, so why is Uhtred not here?    
Why does he remain outlawed?    
Why is Uhtred being punished
for killing Danes?    
He is not being punished
for killing Danes.    
He threat the king's life.    
And continues to threat
the life of the king?    
Uhtred of Bebbanburg would never dare
to harm Alfred nor Edward.    
But what of Uhtred Ragnarson, Father?    
Ealdormen are arriving from across
the land for the celebrations.    
You shouldn't be talking
out of your arse.    
So from now on, Lord, buttocks clenched.    
Supper's in the pot.    
There's a pile of dirt. Soil.    
Where?    
Outside the door.    
You're thinking of something
more than a pile of dirt.    
God forgive me, but I wish
Alfred would close his eyes and die.    
The longer he lingers,
the more anxious people grow.    
Then he should end it himself.    
He should take a sword to his heart.    
He's the king.    
It is what a sword-Dane would do.    
Alfred is holding on to life only because    
he worries what'll happen once he's gone.    
What will happen is fate.
We all die, Beocca.    
It is how we live that matters.    
If the Danes do come to Wessex,
people will see you only as a Dane.    
I worry I will not be
able to protect you.    
The gods will decide what happens.    
"God."    
That is what I said.    
    
 My men are free men still.    
They'll go with you to Winchester,
ensure your safe return.    
I have a guard.
And Wessex is not a land of banditry.    
Priests and ealdormen aside,    
you should never refuse
the offer of a sword, Bishop Erkenwald.    
Is it your intention
to remain at Coccham?    
It's not. My Lord's intention
is to rule at Winchester.    
Is that right?    
My business is my own.    
And your children?
Are Christian now.    
I will ensure they're cared for.    
If it pleases you.    
I will bring my wife to Mercia, Lord.
Meet you there.    
What is happening? Why is she not dead?    
She has beauty and power, Osferth,    
over men who believe
in their own reputation.    
 She's evil.
He has promised her death.    
Pray for him. He'll need it.    
You and I can be everything together.    
I want you to believe in me, Uhtred.
I do.    
 Like I believe in you,
the warrior above all men.    
You're a king.    
Then you are my queen.    
 I am yours and you are mine.    
To love. To guide.    
To own.    
I own you.    
    
    
I thought you would need a fire, Lord.
Something warm to eat.    
    
You saw?    
I did.    
I am not proud of what I've done.    
But it was necessary, Lord.    
She was of the devil
and you are free of her now.    
Why are you here?    
I could not leave, Lord.    
You feared I could not rid myself
of the curse?    
I did.    
I stayed here for the Lady Gisela, Lord.    
This is her hall
and there was no kinder, gentler lady.    
You clearly did not know the Lady Gisela.    
The, uh, marriage arrangements,
Father Beocca...    
What progress?    
Are all but complete.
The guests have begun arriving    
and the alehouses of Winchester
have been brewing day and night.    
It will be the shortest of ceremonies,
Lord, as you have requested.    
Are you comfortable, Lord?
I am not, but it will do.    
The Danes, they are encamped still?    
They do not move.
They have not moved from the River Ouse.    
We continue to watch.    
The defeat of Haesten and Bloodhair
have weakened them, Lord.    
Aethelwold...    
What of him, Lord?    
He is here not just for forgiveness.
He too must be watched.    
He should be dead.    
Although this move from the inn
to the palace is long overdue,    
it comes
at a very inconvenient time of day.    
Were you due
to hump an alehouse whore, Lord?    
Aelflaed, continue to the palace.    
I was due to eat, nothing else.    
Yes, Lord.    
If people have been gossiping,
they are wrong.    
As I hope they are wrong about Edward
having a whore and children.    
 Lord, good morning.    
Whilst you are speaking with the king,    
I was hoping I could spend a few moments
with Lady Aelflaed.    
With respect, I do not think
that would be appropriate.    
I have heard talk
that you have bastard children.    
Is this true?    
I thought we had agreed to
leave all alehouse gossip    
at the alehouse, Lord.    
Lord, perhaps you could direct
the Lady Aelflaed to her room.    
 Of course.    
Do not dwell... Lord.    
The guards may leave us.    
You will leave us.    
Yes, you! Outside!    
There's nothing
beneath their helmets but straw.    
Aethelhelm.
Lord King.    
May I say you appear
a little better this morning.    
Thank you.    
 The king has much to do today.
We shall keep it brief.    
He has called you here to discuss
the strength of Edward and Aelflaed.    
"Strength," Lady?    
Of the Crown, once Edward is king.    
Assuming the witan's approval.
Is that guaranteed?    
If the present king
may be allowed to speak?    
Uhtred.    
A scoundrel, an outlaw.    
A warrior.
 A heathen, surely?    
Christian by birth and baptism.    
That is true?
 It is true.    
He is an outlaw.
If the king may speak.    
Uhtred is also a man of his word.    
Should Edward, once king,
decide to take him into his service,    
that would be no bad thing.    
Lord, this is the man who held a knife
to your throat, so I am told.    
He did.    
And for as long as I live,
he will remain an outlaw.    
However, once I am dead,
and should he become Edward's oath man,    
I am advising you
that his word will be kept.    
I hear you, Lord.    
 Good.    
Perhaps you would like to get on    
with the business of your morning, Lord?    
One point of clarification.    
Uhtred is an outlaw
or he is not an outlaw?    
He is very much an outlaw.
He is.    
If he were found today on Wessex soil,
he would be executed.    
But Edward may take
a different view once king.    
 Or he may not.    
Above all else,
Uhtred does what pleases Uhtred.    
None of us should forget that fact.
Make no mistake.    
Edward will need the guidance
of a warrior.    
The king is tired.
The king is not a child.    
    
I shall go about my business.    
Lord, Lady, thank you
for your confidence.    
If you value the outlaw so highly,
then why do you not pardon him?    
Beocca, would you leave us?    
Yes, Lord.    
It is my body that is weak, not my mind.    
I know that, Lord. I understand.    
Then why do you question me?
Why doubt me?    
I don't doubt you. I would not...    
Edward will need a sword,
a warrior at his side.    
He has Steapa, who is God-fearing.    
He will need Uhtred.    
He will need a man who knows
how to fight and when to fight,    
because the fighting will continue.    
Until the Danes learn of the benefits
of peace, it will continue.    
You may leave me, my dear.    
As you wish.    
I do not pardon Uhtred, firstly,
because he would not accept    
and, secondly,
it must be Edward's decision.    
And it will be your responsibility    
to guide him towards
the correct decision.    
Meanwhile, we are agreed.    
Should he set foot in Wessex,
he will be executed.    
Lord.    
 Finan, look.    
Should you investigate?    
Any spare coins, Lord? Any spare food?
God would bless you, I'm sure.    
Are you traveling to Winchester?
We are, Lord. For the wedding.    
We shall see you there.    
And a good day to you, Lord.    
Miserable bastard.    
Lord God, give me strength and guidance
to do your work.    
If it is right and proper
to rely upon a heathen,    
albeit for violence, then I beg you...    
show me a sign.    
Help me.    
    
I want my son to remain untarnished
by heathen ways.    
I wish him to be God's king.    
Pure.    
Lord. Should you be walking unaided?    
While I can, I will.    
    
I wish to sit in peace.    
Of course.    
Steapa.    
Steapa!    
Ah!    
Do you not recognize me, Steapa?
Why have the gates not opened?    
Bishop Erkenwald, you have guests.    
They rode with us from Coccham.    
Where Uhtred remains.
He'll be going directly to Mercia.    
Steapa, he had hoped
to visit his children there.    
This is true, Lord?
 You do not believe me?    
 It is true
that Uhtred Ragnarson remains at Coccham.    
That is all I know to be true.    
 Uhtred wants to go to Mercia.    
I am to ask the king
to have his children follow.    
Now open the gates and let us rest.    
Hey, big man.    
We're guilty of being hungry and
tired, my friend. That is all.    
Open the gates.    
    
 Hold! Hold the gates.    
Hold! Hold.    
We've traveled from Cent, Lord,    
to bring smiles and laughter
to the streets of Winchester.    
Let them pass.
Thank you, Lord.    
Is that Aethelwold the sword-Dane I see?    
Looks like you've mislaid an eye.    
I see you perfectly, Finan.
Though I do not see your master.    
Uhtred. Where is he?    
Standing at your blind side, perhaps.    
 If his men are here,
Uhtred will not be far.    
I fear he's here for the revenge
we've spoken of.    
Then we must inform the king, perhaps.    
If we are to be successful
in usurping the usurper, Edward,    
Uhtred must be put to the sword.    
I would like the grain and the animals    
taken to the palace stores immediately.    
Your men have been telling me
there's to be a wedding, Lord?    
Edward is to marry, yes. A sweet girl.    
I, uh... I do enjoy a wedding.    
Ale flows and kisses
are a little easier to come by.    
I might stay a short while.    
You are welcome, Finan, I'm sure,
as are your people.    
Finan, I'm away to find my wife.    
Um, she'll be underneath some man.    
And you'll recognize her
by the size of her big... feet.    
I still love her.
    
Finan!
What the... Osferth, you're here?    
So, we are inside the
walls of Winchester.    
Where will he go? To Father Beocca?    
Yes. He'll find us. Be sure of it.    
And he is free of his curse.    
She's dead?
Very.    
Then we're all free of the curse,
baby monk.    
She was of the devil, wasn't she?    
No, more than that.
She was the devil in disguise.    
It is what he would do.
Hmm.    
Ale and women.
And prayer.    
Absolutely. But in that order.
    
    
If you object to me being here,
then say it.    
Let me see your face.    
 Thyra.
    
Uhtred.    
 Inside. Inside.    
Uhtred. Uhtred, it is so good to see you,    
to know that you are alive still.    
I am.    
Alive and well, at last.    
But why are you here? They will kill you.    
I came to see my children and you.    
They will kill you.
We would have come to you in Mercia.    
And I came to help
Ragnar, to save Ragnar.    
He is dead. Beocca has told me...    
Yes, yes...
He is dead.    
He is dead. He is dead.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.    
    
But he is trapped in Niflheim.    
He did not die a warrior's death.
    
That privilege was stolen from him.    
Thyra, only your blood can save him now.    
A cupful, not all of it.    
    
    
Why do you come to the door
armed with a knife?    
Who objects to you being here?    
There are people who
feel I do not belong.    
They see only a Dane.    
But you're Beocca's wife.    
It's because they are afraid.    
You are gone, Alfred is sickly
and warriors are gathering.    
Does Beocca know... of the knife?    
Beocca, he has work to do.    
 However,
there is one slight problem.    
Osferth is a virgin.
 No, it's not true.    
 It's true!    
You need to do it sometime!
    
 Are you surprised
to see me, Father?    
Where is he?    
He was last seen with a witch at Coccham,    
and I don't mean the Abbess Hild.    
Do you have a message for him?    
He knows that his children are safe?    
 He knows they were taken.
He was not best pleased.    
Is he here? You know
I will not summon the guards. Is he here?    
He is.    
Now you can tell me why Aethelwold    
is walking the streets of Winchester
a free man.    
Because rightly or wrongly,
he has been forgiven,    
as I believe Uhtred will be forgiven.
Tell him to find me.    
Um, I think he may well
be sitting at your table, Father.    
Uhtred is here. I know it.
Are any of your men sober?    
Some. They are with the horses.    
We should pay a visit, you and I,
to Father Beocca's house.    
    
    
    
 Thyra? Thyra, it's me, Beocca.
One moment.    
You're bleeding.
Oh, good heavens, what have you done?    
No, I'm... I'm fine.    
You're bleeding. That should be wrapped.
Let me find something.    
Beocca, do not say a word, please.
Uhtred is here for good reason.    
"For good reason"? What reason?    
What is happening here?
What are you doing here?    
 Beocca.
I'm talking to him.    
I am giving Uhtred my blood
to save Ragnar.    
It is true.    
It is paganism, is what it is.    
It is heathen, pagan,
unchristian nonsense.    
You don't understand.
I won't have it!    
 Beocca!
No, no.    
Thyra, please.
No, you will not interfere.    
It is wrong.    
If there's a chance for Ragnar
to find Valhalla,    
then I must offer that chance.    
I do not dismiss your god.    
Because my god is God!    
Ragnar is my blood.    
You will not dismiss
what my people believe.    
Am I not your people?
You are my husband.    
Which is why you must understand.    
 Beocca, we're almost done.    
You will say nothing.
We are almost done.    
Very well. Continue bleeding into a bowl.    
I will wait outside.
I do not care to witness this.    
You are certain of this?    
He is here, trust me.    
And Beocca, what do we do with him?    
He is protecting an outlaw.
Alfred can decide.    
 Go. Go!    
As I'm allowing you to practice    
your misguided pagan
rituals in my home...    
I would ask a favor in return.    
Ask.    
I would like you to speak with Alfred,
if I can arrange it safely.    
What makes you think he'd speak with me?    
Because death is near
and there are things unsaid.    
 If it is not the disgraced,
yet forgiven Lord Aethelwold,    
sword drawn.    
You have stopped, I see,
outside this house.    
 You should
show some respect.    
When you've earned it.
There's an outlaw walking free.    
An outlaw? Who?    
It is not your place to ask.
You're no one to tell me of my place.    
 Father Beocca! Father Beocca!    
What is this?    
I believe you have angry visitors.    
Surround the house. Do it now.    
Surround the house? Whatever for?
They're looking for an outlaw.    
I would like to look inside, Father.
I mean you no harm.    
It is for Alfred and Edward.    
What do you expect to find,
beside my wife?    
Step aside, Father.
I will not.    
We will not.    
You're clearly hiding something.    
With which eye are you looking, boy?
    
Father, I swear, we mean no harm.
This is my home.    
My home! And no man shall enter
without my permission.    
A problem we can help resolve here?    
It is a minor disagreement, that is all,
involving a minor ealdorman.    
Send for Steapa and the king's guard.    
Tell him we have all but captured
Uhtred Ragnarson.    
Lord.
You believe Uhtred is inside my house?    
I do.
You are ever the fool.    
 Beocca?    
Stay inside, my dear.    
Beocca, I have been listening.    
If these men wish to
look inside our home,    
then we should allow it.    
We have nothing to hide, nothing at all.    
Please, come inside, Aethelwold.    
 Come on.    
 Are you satisfied?    
I asked, are you satisfied?    
You have my sincere apologies,
Father, Lady.    
He was here. I can smell him.    
    
Will we see you at the wedding, Lords?    
Where in God's name is he?    
    
 I will leave the wedding feast    
not because I am tired or unwell,    
but because there is work to do.    
 Yes, Lord.    
I will not stay long after the songs.    
Is that wrong?    
No, Lord.    
Father Beocca,
something is troubling you. Say it.    
Leave us.
 Yes, Lord.    
 Lord...    
today is about hope and stab,    
which is what Wessex needs.    
But the fear must be halted, despatched.    
"Fear"?
Yes, Lord.    
It exists in every man and woman.    
My own wife has dug out a hiding hole.    
In fear of her life.    
She has been threat by who?    
By people who themselves are afraid
of life without their king.    
And Edward alone is not the answer.    
You know this yourself, Lord.    
Which is why you hope and pray, perhaps,
that Uhtred will return.    
If that is the case, Lord,
then your prayers have been answered.    
He is here.    
You can have him found and executed...    
or you can speak with him.    
You should wait here.
The king will be with you soon enough.

SEASON: 03
EPISODE: 06
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred. 
Brida told me of my brother's murder. 
Ragnar is dead!  
He doesn't feast in Valhalla!  
Instead, he lies under a pile of stones
at the lake near Loidis!  
 He died because
I remain cursed by Skade. 
 Death comes to us all.  
It is her.  
 To help him cross the bridge
from Hel to Valhalla, 
I must first be rid of her. 
To fight Haesten's army,
you will need an army.   
My father is to join the Mercians
at Aegelesburg. 
 So, with Aethelflaed,
I journeyed to King Alfred,   
to plead for help. 
One thousand men
and I will give you Beamfleot.   
I do not need Beamfleot.   
 When Alfred denied me, 
his son, the aetheling Edward,
promised soldiers. 
Set a day for the attack
and I will be there.   
You shall have the men.   
 With that assurance,
I drew Haesten to the battlefield... 
Run!   
...and into our trap, where we expected 
the king and his men,
who lay in wait, to strike. 
We wait.   
Lord, where is Alfred's army?
   
They're being slaughtered!   
We hold our position.   
   
We cannot just stand by
and watch them die!   
I gave him my word!
Then what will you do, boy?   
You can either bleat
or you can make a decision!   
What will you do?   
 Destiny is all! 
   
Lord King, we cannot wait any longer!   
Lord King!   
   
   
   
Father! We cannot wait!   
We cannot!   
For Wessex!   
And for the king!   
For the king!   
   
   
Edward! It's Edward and his army!   
   
Stand! Every man is to stand!   
Dagfinn! Every man is to stand!   
 It's Alfred.   
He lives.   
Stand! Every man is to stand!   
Stand!   
She's why we're here, Lord! Take her!   
   
   
No!   
No!   
   
   
   
   
 Lord!   
It's Osferth.   
   
Osferth?   
He's alive, Lord.
Maybe next time we'll be lucky, eh?   
Did you see me fighting, Lord?
I did.   
It was a sight to behold.   
I hope I killed no man.    
You gave many a sore head.   
I feel cold.   
Because it's winter, you fool.   
You were a warrior today, Osferth.   
Am I to die, Lord?   
I do not fear it.   
I forbid it.   
You dare die, baby monk,
and I'll kill you myself.   
Right. I'll try not to, then.   
We will return to Aethelflaed's estate.
You will recover there.   
Yes, Lord.   
What of Skade?   
She's been taken by Haesten.   
Then nothing has changed.
We remain cursed still.   
I am cursed.   
It touches us all, Lord.   
It continues.   
   
 Uhtred, Lord. As you ordered.   
 Thank you, Steapa.   
I assume your vengeance included
reclaiming the seer, Skade?   
She is why you are here?   
Instead, I reclaimed your fortress, Lord.   
The victory was decisive.
You have my thanks.   
I feared you would not join the battle.   
I was tempted to wait a little longer.    
I would've seen victory without you.    
It would have been all you deserved.    
It was Edward who ordered the attack.
It needed to be Edward.    
You owe him your thanks.    
He fought with courage.    
If I were his father, I would be proud.    
When I spoke with Skade,    
she foretold I should not
live to see another summer.    
Skade preys on men's fears, Lord.    
Nevertheless, I know it to be true.    
I know how my body weakens daily.    
In a matter of months,
weeks even, I shall be gone,    
and Edward shall be king.    
He has proven himself.    
He has proven that he has courage...    
but also that he can be manipulated.    
You used him to serve your own purpose.    
No, Lord, he saw a way
to weaken an enemy.    
The Danes' march was halted.
They will not attack this winter.    
You do your son a disservice,
all to accuse me of manipulation!    
For one reason or another, you have,
it seems, earned Edward's favor.    
He kept his word.    
Yes.    
All that I ask is that
you do not forget what he has done.    
Oh, I will not forget.    
Nor will I forget that his father has
taken from me everything that was mine.    
You are free to go anywhere but Wessex,
Bebbanburg should you choose,    
but those lands are as distant as ever.    
As is England, Lord.    
The Danes will never leave these shores.    
Never.    
I will go to
the Lady Aethelflaed's estate.    
She remains in danger, I believe.    
Lord King.    
    
Fetch me Cnut. He needs to see this.    
Haesten looks a broken man.    
 He looks like shit.    
He brings my woman.    
    
Lord Haesten, my friend.
 Cnut.    
    
 Point your cock
somewhere else, Bloodhair.    
The woman is mine, make no mistake.    
What has happened?    
 I have lost everything,
bar what you see.    
You've lost more than half your men.    
And my man, Dagfinn.
How?    
Alfred lives, that is how.
They came at night in their thousands.    
He lives?
And Uhtred is with him.    
Who says Alfred lives?    
I say.    
I saw him on horseback,
as strong as he has ever been.    
That is a nonsense. It must be.    
He lives!    
And half my men do not!    
If Uhtred is with Alfred,
then it is over before it has begun.    
Nothing is over. Nothing is over!
We are strong still!    
How'd you come by Skade?
Skade's not important.    
Haesten spared Uhtred.    
You will shut your mouth!    
It's true.    
We do not care.    
He could've easily killed Uhtred
and the princess,    
but instead, he desired me.    
He thinks with his cock.    
You find that amusing?    
I've missed her sharp tongue.    
She is mine. I will lose nothing more!    
We are meant to be one army.    
Haesten, rest.    
Then the three of us shall sit and decide
how we are to proceed.    
A war council.    
You mean four of us?    
Aethelwold, another word from you
and I shall take your head.    
Very well.    
 Not another word.    
    
    
You have no appetite?    
No appetite for celebration.    
What is it you are holding?    
Thor's hammer.    
Yes.    
From Ragnar the Fearless.    
I have told you?    
Once or twice.    
They will be together now...    
father and son, in Valhalla.    
That is what you believe, isn't it?    
I must go to him.    
My men will remain here.    
Uhtred, I know what you have
sacrificed to come to my aid.    
I know how much it has cost you.    
It was my choice, Lady.    
It is what I wanted to do.    
I would like you
to have Mercia as your home,    
to live here with your men.    
I can identify land...    
Thank you, Lady,
but say nothing more. Please.    
    
Where are the prisoners being taken?    
To the hall, to be fed upon my orders.    
Come join us, Lady Aethelflaed...    
Hold your tongue, Dagfinn,
or I will cut it out!    
I do not like my enemies within my walls.    
I will leave you to your peace.    
    
How's Osferth?    
Sleeping. As we should all be.    
Just as soon as he's recovered,
we should attempt to recover Skade.    
Once again.    
So long as she is free, Lord,
you are cursed.    
Skade is with the Danes.
We cannot reach her.    
We will not chase her to our deaths.    
Death will find us regardless.    
Do you have something to say, Sihtric?
He does not.    
Except that enough of us
have died already.    
 You are a warrior.
Death is a hazard.    
I've decided to go to Ragnar.
I must help him find peace.    
All you will find
at Ragnar's graveside is ghosts.    
You will keep watch of Aethelflaed
and you will rest.    
No man who serves Uhtred can rest,
not until Skade is reclaimed.    
 Sihtric, you are drunk and tired.    
Yes, I am tired...    
of marching north and then south,
being called a traitor,    
of abandoning my wife!    
For what?    
Then leave.
 You don't mean that.    
If you are unhappy in my service, leave!    
I have fought for you!    
You fight because you enjoy it.    
You'd dismiss me this easily?    
Stay or go, I do not care.    
He does not mean that. He does care.
Now, let us all sit.    
Stay or go, Sihtric Kjartanson.
It is your choice.    
Make it!    
If you wish to make the square,
Uhtred of Bebbanburg, let us do it.    
No, there'll be no squares made,
no fighting, just sleep!    
Sleep!    
Jesus!    
Get the prisoners back
with the pigs, bound.    
Sihtric!    
I will leave first light...    
but I will return.    
And if you are here still...    
then I will kill you.    
Why?    
    
He has cursed us all!    
She has cursed you all
and Uhtred allows it.    
Shut your mouth.    
Abandon him, boy. It's your only chance.    
You're a Dane first and last.    
 Quiet!
    
    
You abandoned your fortress
and your men abandoned you.    
Some.    
You fell into Alfred's trap.    
I was told that Alfred was dead.    
By your messenger.    
The trap was Uhtred's.    
Alfred brought his armies to Beamfleot    
because that is what Uhtred asked of him.    
Alfred will die soon enough,
but Uhtred we want dead.    
He should have died at Dunholm,
but Ragnar was weak.    
If we are to make Wessex ours,
we must rid it of its talisman.    
Uhtred of Bebbanburg must die.    
The days are short.    
We've been weakened,
and Ragnar's death is an omen.    
Wessex must wait.    
Aethelwold, you will
return to Winchester.    
I cannot.    
I will not.    
For what reason?    
Your long-promised Saxon
army It's time to deliver us    
Once Alfred is dead, yes.    
Aethelred is ripe for betrayal,
as are many men of Wessex,    
but as a corpse, I can do nothing.    
Alfred would kill me.    
You'll ask for forgiveness.
I would be ignored.    
Then you will beg!    
You will deliver me a Saxon army,    
and if Uhtred has joined
Alfred at Winchester,    
you will kill him.    
I will kill him, how?    
As you killed Ragnar.    
Lord...     
 He wouldn't have the balls.    
Lord Cnut, you must learn
to hold your tongue.    
This fool killed Ragnar?    
Cnut is joking with you.    
While he slept.    
He was not sleeping.    
It was either he died or I died.    
I am no fool.    
This fact goes no further
than this table.    
Are you part of this?    
I'm no longer concerned by his death.    
You wish to lead?    
Ragnar should never have allowed
Uhtred to live.    
He should never have allowed him
to leave with your woman.    
Who is now my woman.    
Who will take Ragnar's men?    
Ragnar's men belong to Brida.    
They merely await her return.    
Aethelwold, you will leave tomorrow.    
So, I am journeying to Wessex
to become a corpse,    
and from my grave,    
I am to raise an army and kill the
greatest warrior in the land.    
Hmm.    
    
Ale, Lord?    
Always.    
And thank you for reminding me
I am a lord, Offa...    
my faithful servant.    
You and I are to make a journey.    
I shall return to Winchester,    
whereas, you will travel
from peasant to lord.    
I do not understand.    
Of course you don't. You're stupid.    
As I have been stupid.    
However...    
complete this next task,    
and your reward will be land and title,
Ealdorman Offa.    
    
I will get you out of here,
but you will take me to your camp.    
You're no longer sworn to Uhtred, boy?    
Uhtred is cursed and has lost his mind.    
I am at the mercy of gods
and this is their will.    
Are you with me or not?    
    
 I knew you would come.    
He calls to me in my dreams.    
From Niflheim.    
Asking me to help him cross
from Hel into Valhalla.    
If there is one thing I could do,
it would be that.    
You're here for forgiveness.    
You abandoned him three times over.    
That was through fate, not choice.    
    
What are you doing? We will freeze!    
Niflheim is much colder
than you will ever be.    
If Ragnar suffers, then so shall we.    
There will be no comfort for you here.    
I'm going to sleep.    
Wrapped in fur?    
Give me your strength...    
your heart and your wisdom.    
Give me your love, brother.    
    
    
 You shall always have mine.    
Edward.    
You look very clean today,
apart from this mark here.    
Mother, please.    
She teases you.
Stop.    
Lord, I do not mean to disturb.    
There was a matter
I thought we might discuss.    
Speak your mind, Edward.
The king appreciates honesty.    
I do not regret what was done,    
giving my word to Uhtred,    
honoring my word and the battle
that followed, the victory...    
but I acknowledge
I went beyond what is my right.    
I went against you, even.    
I shall accept any punishment
you think necessary.    
Without my permission,
you swore my men to a traitor.    
You led my armies
into a battle I did not sanction.    
Your actions were not worthy
of an aetheling.    
They were worthy of a king.    
Wessex shall soon be yours.    
For now, it is strong,
but England remains fragile.    
Its future will not only be secured
with battles and with men,    
but with unions.    
We should like you to meet
the Lady Aelflaed.    
It is time.    
It is a match that will strengthen Wessex
and the crown.    
Your crown.    
I will do my utmost, Lord...    
for Wessex and for my king.    
    
 Do you know them?    
 They look like Danes.    
Yes, but do you know them?
No.    
 We should leave.
We can eat later.    
And go where?    
To a shithole village
on the road to Legaceaster.    
I do not know how we can help
Ragnar escape Niflheim,    
but I will not return
to my own life until I've tried.    
What is at this village?    
A seer.    
Do you remember Storri?    
Storri is a piece of shit.
He is, but he was Ubba's seer...    
a Sword Dane's seer.    
If any man will know
how to reach a lost warrior, it is him.    
They have gone.    
We can be at the village in two days.    
Yeah.    
One more arrow and I will take your eyes!    
I know who sent you!    
You do?    
Tell Cnut I will return when I'm ready!    
Cnut will want the Dane-Slayer dead.    
He's with me!    
He has my protection!    
His head will be worth its weight
in silver.    
I have a very small head.    
Come out!    
Uhtred is mine to kill... when I'm ready.    
Now go, while you still have your balls.    
Cnut will hear that
you are protecting him.    
Tell Cnut I will return,
and when I do, he will have my men.    
He will know what that means.    
Now, go.    
Go!    
You do not change, woman.    
I spared you for Ragnar.    
I am told that Uhtred has ridden north
to Ragnar's grave.    
Alone or with his men?    
Alone.    
His men remain with Aethelflaed.    
I see.    
He is a man in great need
of the guidance of God.    
Lord, I could place Uhtred
in the waters a thousand times    
and he would not find God,
only fish.     
My son will need him.    
It pains me greatly to say it,
but it is true.    
Edward will need Uhtred.    
But he is an outlaw. He must remain
an outlaw until I am gone.    
That is your wish, Lord?    
That is what I wish,
but I can say it only to you.    
It cannot become a command.    
My wife is sure to oppose any bond
between Edward and Uhtred.    
But Edward must make his own decision...    
with your counsel, Father Beocca.    
Yes, Lord.    
You plan to give your men to Cnut?    
They're my men.    
Will you become Cnut's woman?    
It's none of your business.    
Will you?    
I must survive.    
Men won't follow a woman for long.
They're too stupid.    
But Cnut?    
He's a weasel.    
Well, what do you suggest?    
That I give my men to you,
we attack Bebbanburg?    
Because that's something
you'll never do because you're a Saxon.    
He's a weasel.    
You deserve better than Cnut
is what I'm saying.    
It's your turn to shit.    
I do not need to shit.    
Then let's go and find this turd, Storri.    
This is the second time
we have gone in search of Storri.    
The last time, you dispatched him
with a stick up his arse.    
I remember.    
Never forgotten.    
We were so young then.    
We were Danes then.    
Race you over the hill?    
Why?
Why not?    
Child.    
Afraid of losing?    
Child.    
    
    
I think of Gisela every morning
I wake and every night before I sleep.    
I understand.    
I should despise Ragnar for whoring...    
but I can't.    
You loved him.    
More than he knew.    
The thought of him in Hel
is not one I can bear.    
    
I swear I will not leave your side    
until we have found a way to help him.    
Or until you have killed me.    
 Then we must
find a way quickly    
because I'm sure to kill you soon.    
I can't forgive you, Uhtred...    
for failing him.    
One time.
Three times.    
Once.    
I made one mistake.
I gave one year's service to Alfred.    
You gave your life.    
I swore an oath to Alfred
for a second time    
because I had no choice.    
A man always has a choice.    
After the Battle of Ethandun,
when Ragnar became Alfred's hostage,    
he was sent north by Alfred
to free me from my slavers.    
I was there.    
Ragnar saved me...    
and then we rode to save Gisela...    
whereupon I killed a priest.    
Good.    
And because Ragnar did not prevent it...    
because...    
I was in Ragnar's charge,
Alfred did blame Ragnar.    
He was going to have him
put on trial and then killed.    
The options given to me
were to swear a second oath to Alfred,    
or my brother's life.    
You didn't tell Ragnar.    
From Ragnar...    
and from me.    
I have always loved you.    
    
Not as a wife.    
    
No longer as a wife.    
    
But you will always be half my life.    
And all of your madness,
is what you said.    
    
It's true.    
This is it?    
This is where we find Storri?    
I see him.
Huh?    
The gods are with us.    
    
And this is from your wife?    
    
What is it?    
It's bad.    
The ale?    
Your wife, she will bear many children...    
but none shall be born living.    
I'm sorry, the gods can be cruel.    
There must be something you can do.    
I suggest you find a new wife.    
    
I despise him.    
We need him.    
    
    
    
Come no closer.    
I have skill!    
Storri, you have chickens,
a goat and a bad smell.    
That is all.    
Uhtred Ragnarson.    
And you, I know you, too.    
Oh, I remember.    
All we want is your knowledge.    
In exchange for your life.    
She shamed me.    
You shamed me, with a branch!    
I shat blood for days!    
Storri! We will pay.    
We will not!    
We mean you no harm and we will pay.    
She is to come nowhere near my arse.
You understand?    
    
You swear it!    
She will come nowhere near your arse.    
 I liked Young Ragnar
and his father, the Fearless.    
    
For him to be lost
in the cold of Niflheim,    
no true warrior deserves such a fate.    
Then you will help us?    
I would like to.    
But that would mean
walking with the gods,    
asking for a solution,
perhaps time and time again.    
And each time would require payment.    
We're not here to be robbed.    
No.    
You're here to save Young Ragnar.    
Right?    
You will give us the answer tonight.
Or you will die tonight.    
Is she allowed to speak to me like that?    
Help us and you will be paid,
but it must be tonight.    
Well, then,
you should allow me to prepare.    
You're in luck, though.    
I have everything I need and Young Ragnar
will share in that good luck.    
We need to kill a chicken.    
But not the small one. She has a name.    
What is she called?    
I wouldn't be surprised if he humps it.
    
Storri?    
 Uhtred?    
 He's gone. He's gone!    
I swear I did not mean to run.    
Just habit.    
My curse,    
I'm assuming it worked.    
It did.    
It cost me a family and my husband.    
I... I can make amends.    
I can help you reach Ragnar.    
I liked him.
    
Please, don't kill me.    
Don't let her kill me.    
I can see she'd like to.    
He says he can help us.
I heard.    
You might think I'm afraid of death.
I'm not.    
I think there are times
I would even welcome it.    
Almost finished.    
What is it you are using?    
Don't you need mushrooms
to walk with the gods?    
Oh, yes, mushrooms are vital.    
This is a mixture for something else.    
What?    
This is to help me... shit.    
You are playing with us.    
No.    
    
    
Perhaps I am.    
And perhaps this was poison
to help me end my life.    
    
    
I am playing with you.    
But it does help me shit.    
You will tell us how to help Ragnar    
or I swear I will cut you cock to throat.    
I know exactly how to help him.    
Then say it!
And nothing more.    
Very well.    
    
The Goddess Hel...    
will surrender your brother's soul,    
but only in return for another.    
You must kill the man who killed Ragnar.    
The man who denied him.    
You will wet the blade
with the blood of Ragnar,    
and with that blade only must you kill
the man who sent him to Hel.    
Only that way will he be free to enter
the feast halls of Valhalla.    
    
Ragnar is dead.    
His blood is black. It's dust, almost.    
Might his blood be in others?    
Thyra.    
Who's Thyra?    
Ragnar's sister. Blood sister.    
Then, you have it.    
Now, pay me well and leave me in peace.    
Thank you.    
I have one more thing to ask.    
I will pay.    
Ask.    
How do you kill a curse?    
I knew it.    
I saw the darkness on your shoulder.    
It's yours.    
 Do you have something for me,
Uhtred?    
    
 Brida, no!    
Yes! Trust me!
Don't touch him! Don't touch him!    
Trust me! Don't do anything!    
Don't!    
    
    
    
Brida?    
 I just did what one
has to do to break a curse.    
You have to kill the sorcerer
without breaking the skin    
and without shedding one drop of blood.    
You've got to do the same to Skade.    
If you can't, you can
make her your woman.    
He cursed you when?    
A long time ago.
We were young.     
He threw a curse,    
I stuck a branch up his arse.
It was that day.    
I've been a barren bitch ever since.    
You have lifted your own curse.    
Yes. For what it's worth.    
Why not sooner?    
Because I was a warrior first.    
Because I'm a fool.    
You are no fool.    
But you are the bravest warrior.    
I knew how to kill a curse
since before you arrived at Dunholm.    
I chose not to tell you...    
because I knew you wouldn't stay.    
So, I wanted to see you suffer.    
I did love you, Uhtred,
but that has passed.    
I do not believe you.    
We are one, you and I.    
From the moment I took your hand    
on the steps of the
great hall of Eoferwic,    
we were bound as one.    
You may dislike me,    
hate me if you wish, despise me at times.    
    
But love is immortal.    
It goes on.    
I will find Skade
and I must kill this curse.    
Then I will go to Thyra.    
I will discover who killed Ragnar.    
We send him on his way to Valhalla?    
At some point,
I'll see you on the battlefield.    
I won't hesitate to kill you.    
That does not mean you do not love me.

SEASON: 03
EPISODE: 05
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred.  
King Alfred grows weaker each day,  
leaving Wessex vulnerable
to enemies within.  
Aethelwold is there?
 They will march  
from north to south as a single army.  
 I, too, am now seen as a threat.  
But I've promised to protect
Alfred's daughter, Aethelflaed.  
Your husband intends to kill you.  
I shall leave now,
and you must do the same.   
 Indeed, both Aethelred
and Haesten wish her dead.   
Saving her life
has come at a high cost to me.   
Skade in place of Aethelflaed.   
You are cursed once more,
Uhtred of Bebbanburg.   
I've been thinking about Ragnar
and him killing me.   
I should kill him first.   
 My brother has disowned me
as a traitor.   
And it is true.   
You are no longer my brother!   
 I betrayed him by leaving him   
in the company of my men without honor.
   
   
   
 Destiny is all.   
 He's dead!   
He's dead!   
 Alfred is dead! He's dead!   
Alfred's dead!   
The Saxon cur is no more! He's dead!
   
Alfred is dead!   
Jackdaw, is this true?
How did you hear this?   
It's all over the country, they say.
He's dead!   
Alfred shat his precious soul
out of his arsehole.   
   
Ragnar, Alfred is dead!   
The Saxon shit is gone!   
Ragnar!   
Ragnar?   
Ragnar?   
   
   
Ragnar.   
Ragnar.   
   
   
Take it. Close your hand.   
Ragnar. Ragnar, close your hand
and take this.   
Ragnar, take this.   
Ragnar, take it! No!   
No!   
No, Ragnar, no!   
No! No!   
No!   
No!    
 So, he's dead. This is good news.   
 No! No!   
Ragnar! Ragnar!   
Ragnar, no!    
 Move. Move!   
   
Ragnar, no. No.   
   
Who?   
Who did this?   
His whore?   
I will ask.   
   
   
Ragnar Ragnarson,
the only man amongst you, is dead!   
Who did this?
   
Cowards! All of you!   
You had to kill him
while he was sleeping?   
Brida, it was his woman.
   
The knife was in her hand.   
It was Ragnar's sword in her belly.   
Why would he kill a woman
he was trying to pup?   
Why would she kill him? How?   
Maybe it was you who killed him.   
Her husband was ploughing another field,   
so the crazy bitch killed them both.   
   
Bloodhair, no.   
   
   
This is not the answer.   
He was your leader!   
He was to give you wealth! Protection!   
 We go on.   
Nothing has changed.
Everything has changed.   
We go on.
   
You...   
You have no leader.   
Then I shall lead.   
With Bloodhair.   
We will bury Ragnar, and we will march.   
Get it done, and keep her quiet.   
Release her.   
   
Though I did not know him well,
he was a good man.   
A brave warrior.    
    
Are you going to behave?    
You speak to him as if he understands.    
He will not understand the words, but...    
he will know I'm a friend.    
Someone he can trust.    
So, when the time comes to push him
into battle, he will not hesitate.    
Is that the way you treat your men?    
You win their trust
and expect them to follow?    
It is not a game, nor a strategy.    
It is who you are.    
A man who instills trust.    
I would like you to kiss me.    
And then?    
Begin with a kiss and see where it leads.    
If you would rather not...
It is something I would enjoy...    
and then regret.    
Lady, in Erik, you chose someone
you could not be with.    
And I am the same.    
I would not see you hurt again.    
Who would have to know?    
Who would need to know...
Skade. Skade would know.    
She would see
everything I care for destroyed.    
    
She must be found, recovered.    
I would say, it is impossible for you
to recover her.    
I must.
How?    
You cannot attack Beamfleot.    
To fight Haesten's army,
you will need an army.    
My Father is to join the Mercians
at Aegelesburg.    
I will meet him with our guards
and Aethelred.    
You will be safer there than here.    
It is a good decision.    
I will tell the king
of Haesten's attempt to kill me.    
By attacking me,
he has made himself an enemy of Wessex.    
Come with me.    
My father will forgive you,    
and you will lead his
men against Beamfleot.    
I do not want his forgiveness.
Then use his army.    
Use his men, and recover Skade.    
I offer you a way to end this curse.    
Lord, we are ready...    
for another chapter.    
The country is rife
with word of my death, I am told.    
So what a fright you shall be
to the Danes,    
marching beyond Wessex and into Mercia    
to stand by the side of Aethelred
and look them in the eye.    
To look them in the eye.    
Yes.    
Steapa, when you are ready.    
Yes, Lord.    
    
We march!    
Men of Wessex...    
we march!    
    
Leave us.    
Some of his men believe
this to be a sign.    
For Ragnar to die without his sword
means the battle can't be won.    
They're your men now.    
You must convince them otherwise.    
I won't prevent any man
from returning north.    
They have no leader.
We can lead.    
You and I.    
This morning you said you'd
lead with Bloodhair, now you choose me?    
I do not wish to bed Bloodhair.    
 Already we're divided.    
Without Ragnar,
we shall become separate tribes.    
I will let you grieve.
    
You'll find us at River Ouse.    
One army.    
It was either you or Bloodhair
who killed Ragnar.    
You cannot accept that his last
night was spent with a whore    
and that she killed him.    
Who knows what goes on between
a man and a woman?    
Ragnar did not appreciate
nor deserve your love.    
    
    
 We have lost a great warrior.    
A great man.    
I know this better than most.    
Ragnar Ragnarson was my cousin.    
And I'm angry with him    
because he deserved a better death!
    
killed half naked. killed without
his breeches and his sword!    
Far from the battlefield.    
It is a death I fear most.    
    
It is a death our great warrior Bloodhair
fears most.    
But we men standing here
are fortunate men!    
The gods are with us.
 Yes!    
We have swords in hand
and a battle ahead of us.    
Land to be won, silver to be shared    
and Saxons to kill!
    
We are Danes together!    
    
Together!    
 Together!    
    
    
Osferth.    
Fetch Uhtred.    
Tell him we have a guest. A woman.    
How can you tell it's a woman?    
You have to ask?    
Fetch Uhtred.    
I knew you'd be with your princess.    
Something has happened?    
You left him.    
Ragnar?    
He had waited years for you to come home    
and within a matter of
days you were gone.    
You should've left the
Saxon bitch to die.    
Where is he? I will go to him.    
He's dead! Ragnar is dead!    
He doesn't feast in Valhalla.    
Instead, he lies under a pile of stones
at a lake near Loidis!    
There was no honor in his death.    
None.    
He will spend eternity
in the cold of Niflheim,    
because of you, Uhtred of Bebbanburg.    
    
You chose her.    
You chose Alfred and you left him.
    
No, Sihtric.    
I should kill you...    
but I want you to live
with the pain of his death.    
He was your brother.    
Uhtred, I...    
My brother is dead.    
Oh, God.    
 It is her.    
Skade and her curse.    
It goes on and on.    
Could it not be just life?    
Death comes to us all.    
It is her.    
She must be recovered.    
We go to Alfred and to Aethelred.    
We do?    
And we beg for an army.    
Once the last of Bloodhair's men
sail up the Ouse...    
we will march on Mercia...
    
...and then Wessex.    
He will have me send you to him.    
Bloodhair.    
It is I who choose who I sit with.    
Lie with.    
kill.    
You have only ever taken women.    
They do not give themselves to you.    
Whether it is given or taken,    
I get what I want.    
You may take my body,    
but you will not have my power.
    
I have  ,    men.    
That is power enough.    
The man I choose, he will benefit greatly
from Alfred's death.    
But I will have to give myself
to that man...    
and only when it is earned.    
Maybe, I should just hump you now    
and be done with it.    
Prove yourself, Lord.    
    
Prove myself...    
to a woman?    
And I will allow you inside me
and my power inside you.    
Uhtred will come for me    
and if you are to take his place,
then you must first kill him.    
And then I am yours.    
    
    
 Riders.    
Spears to the walls!    
    
No man is to pass. No man.    
I ought to kill you
where you stand, Lord.    
You could try, my friend.    
I'm here to see the king.    
You ride with outlaws, my dear.    
 He's an outlaw of Wessex,
not Mercia.    
We're here to see my father.    
What is it you have to say to the king    
that you cannot say to your husband?    
I wish to speak of
treachery and traitors.    
The Dane Haesten did attack
the nunnery at Wincelcumb.    
It was his purpose to kill me.    
 Haesten claims
to be a friend to Alfred.    
He's not.    
Let the outlaw pass.    
No weapon.    
None at all.    
 Lord Aethelred,    
like you, we stand against the Danes.    
 No weapon
is the command, Irishman.    
None at all.    
It is good to see you safe, Lady.    
Lord Aldhelm.    
I shall advise the king you're here.    
My father cannot suspect
my husband is the traitor.    
We should kill your husband
and be done with it.    
And begin a war
between Wessex and Mercia now?    
Lady, I'm joking.
We'll kill him tomorrow.    
We halt. Stop!    
We know what "halt" means, big man.    
Steapa, we are both thirsty and hungry.    
You may enter the hall, Lady.    
The outlaws do not.    
Then I choose to remain here
with the outlaws.    
As you wish.    
Um, what if I need to piss?    
Then take out your cock.    
And if you mistake it for a weapon,
what then?    
Steapa, food and ale
would be appreciated.    
I will arrange it.    
And Steapa, good food.    
Meat and lots of ale!    
    
If Uhtred is no longer with the Danes,
that is one matter.    
But should he realign himself
with Alfred or Edward,    
that is another.    
What has occurred to bring Uhtred
from one side to the other?    
He is Uhtred.    
Who called him from north to south?    
My wife?
How, Lord?    
Why?    
Why did she call him to her aid?    
What does she know?    
Is it important?    
When Danes are marching
and we are unsure of which side we stand?    
Yes, it is important.    
Very!    
She knew of the danger posed by me.    
She fled,    
summoned Uhtred...    
with the promise of her bed, no doubt.    
She knew.    
Then, Lord, may I suggest,
we first establish    
what business Uhtred has with her father.    
I want all of my men at the ready.    
For what?    
If she is here to accuse me,
to discredit me,    
we must be ready.    
Yes, Lord.    
Steapa.
Lord Sigebriht.    
An approximation to a witan has gathered.    
The outlaws are required.    
What is an approximation to a witan?    
It's almost a witan, but not quite.    
We must be without the king.    
Apologies for keeping you waiting
in the cold, my dear.    
Your father is to blame.    
After deliberation,
he has decided not to attend.    
I am here in place of the king.    
I'm here to speak for the king.    
Our business is with Alfred.    
Edward is Alfred.    
On this occasion.    
We are all curious
of what you have to say, my dear.    
Speak.    
Danes are near.    
Yes. Which is why we are gathered.    
This is not some hunting party.    
Haesten is with them.
His army is allied with them.    
But it was Haesten
who first advised the king    
that the Danes were marching south.    
He would do that, Lord.    
Haesten also advised the king    
this Dane army included yourself,
Uhtred Ragnarson.    
It does not, Father.    
Which we can clearly see.    
Haesten has betrayed the king.    
He rode to Mercia to kill me.    
Uhtred saved me.    
God is good. Praise him!    
 Praise him.    
 I am at a loss.    
How is it that Uhtred
knew of this danger?    
    
How is it that he knew
exactly where to find you?    
An interesting question, Lord.    
An irrelevant question.    
Uhtred made a plan with this Dane,
this Haesten,    
to save you, to gain your trust,    
gain entry to this estate.
No.    
A spy.    
An assassin.
    
 No, he saved me.    
I should've expected nothing different.    
He has risked all for me...    
That's what
he wants you to believe, surely.    
Seems a rather grand strategy,
Lord Aethelred.    
And for what?
He is here, among us.    
 And under guard.    
Then let us get to the truth
of the matter.    
Let us hear exactly why Uhtred is here.    
What do you have to say to me?    
I wish to speak to you alone.    
This is a witan. We are one people.    
What you have to say affects all of us.    
These men are my friends and allies.
I have nothing to hide.    
I saved your daughter's life.    
It was Haesten's intention to kidnap her.    
If that could not be done,
he would have killed her.    
And you claim that he, too, is your ally.    
I've never made that claim.    
I have listened to Haesten,
but I've never believed him fully.    
That you are here with Aethelflaed
is the only reason you are alive.    
Do not tell me what you have done.
Tell us all what it is you want.    
You always want something.    
I want  ,    men.
    
One thousand men,
and I will give you Beamfleot.    
I do not need Beamfleot.    
I will give you peace.    
I will defeat Haesten.    
I will prevent him from joining
with the Earls Cnut and Bloodhair.    
Not forgetting the Earl Ragnar.    
My brother is dead, Lord.    
    
 That is to your advantage.    
With Haesten defeated and Ragnar gone,    
the Danes will have
half the army and no leader.    
To prevent a great war,
you must attack Haesten.    
That seems viable, Lord.    
You wish me to divide my army?
Yes.    
 Send  ,    men east?
Yes.    
That is too great a risk to Wessex, Lord.    
Haesten sits inside a fortress.    
One thousand men could die
upon its walls easily.    
And then what?
We are overrun.    
We devise a plan.    
Why?    
What is at stake for Uhtred Ragnarson?    
Is it Mercia you care for? Is it Wessex?    
There another reason for this attack?    
Vengeance, Lord.    
Do you require the detail?
You seek vengeance?    
I do.
 The man is a fool,    
who believes all of us to be fools.    
You arrived here under the protection
of the Lady of Mercia.    
I shan't undermine that protection.    
You are free to leave
when you are ready and rested.    
You remain an outlaw of Wessex.    
    
    
Are you here to join me in prayer,
Father Pyrlig?    
I am not.     
My Lord Edward would like to speak
with Uhtred.    
About what?    
I would like to give him hope, Father.    
Hope.
Half the number of men he asked for.    
Or more.
Ah.    
But only if it were to bring a peace,
till the spring at least.    
 Edward needs time.    
My father's sickness has cast a shadow.    
And I, uh...    
I'm not yet ready to...    
 bring light.    
Cometh the hour.    
I fear a great battle now
would have only one outcome, defeat.    
But if we were able to weaken the Danes
as Uhtred has suggested...    
We need to hear more of his plan.    
Forgive me.    
There is nothing to forgive, Lord.    
You have the wisdom of a king.    
Should I bring him to you? Uhtred?    
We could all at least listen.
He does plan well.    
 Yes. Do that.    
You are going to fetch him now?    
Yes, Lord.    
I should meet him privately. Where?    
Thinking on it, Lord,    
may I suggest you meet
him in clear sight,    
as though nothing is secret nor hidden?    
 She shames me    
with every breath
that she continues to take.    
There are more pressing matters, Lord.    
You continue to defend her, Aldhelm.    
It has not gone unnoticed.    
 My concern is Mercia
and Aethelred.    
Always.    
What's this?    
Who does Edward imagine himself to be?    
I came to sit with my sister for a while.    
My sister, the outlaw.    
You grow by the day, Edward.    
He grows wiser.    
Slowly, but hopefully.    
If you would excuse me.    
I was sorry to hear of Ragnar's death.    
He was a heathen, but a good man.
I shall pray for him.    
Amen.    
He would not thank you
for your prayers, Father.    
Well, they are his all the same.    
I pray for you, too, Uhtred.    
And I will not stop,
in spite of your pigheadedness.    
And me, Father?    
Oh, I'm afraid you belong
to the devil already.    
Hmm. You could well be right.    
Should we get on with the matter,
Father Beocca?    
Sooner we get back, the better.    
Yes. Edward is here...    
because he has something to say, to ask.    
For the sake of appearances,
you should all try to behave    
as if you're completely disinterested.    
How... how many men does Haesten have?    
Maybe as many as  ,   .    
And a fortress.    
Beamfleot.    
 I wish to understand why    
you believe you can defeat him
when it appears impossible.    
Laying siege to the fortress
would take  ,       
and many would die.    
But I would use his hatred of me
to draw him out.    
We could feint an attack with
a small number of men and then retreat.    
Haesten will not be able to resist
the opportunity of killing me.    
On open ground, with an army,
we will have a chance.    
Men will still die.    
It is war.    
Men will die at Beamfleot
or they will die here, and at Winchester.    
But as I said to the king,    
defeating Haesten
could well prevent a greater war.    
 And that is no false claim, Lord.    
Nothing deters a warrior more
than the news of defeat.    
It's a plan that can work,
but Uhtred will need men.    
An army.    
And I do not wish the devil
to take me too easily.    
There's a thick forest
surrounding Beamfleot.    
A good place to hide an army.    
 Yes, Lord.    
A good place to hide     men, or more?    
Then you shall have them.    
Is that a promise you can keep, Lord?    
It is, or I can never be called king.    
Edward, you are certain?    
Set a day for the attack
and I will be there.    
You shall have the men.    
Draw Haesten out of the fort.    
Our army will be hidden
in the woods, waiting.    
You have my word.    
I swear.    
 Open the gates.    
    
    
You cannot do what you have promised
without the approval from the king.    
 I will speak to him.    
Do not leave it too late.    
If he denies you, leave time
to ask him again and again.    
To beg?    
If needed, yes.    
It was cold, so I lit a fire.    
I hope you don't mind.    
We have servants to light fires.    
Come. Sit.    
I do not have an appetite.    
When will you return to Wincelcumb?    
Oh, I have no plans to return.    
I have assigned my guard to Uhtred,    
and will remain here
to go with my husband    
and the men of Mercia into battle.    
May I say...    
you did not appear concerned...    
nor surprised, Lord,    
at Haesten's attempt to kill your wife.    
    
Does my reaction now meet
with your approval?    
It does.    
Thank you.    
My dear...    
I assure you that I will not rest    
until I find the truth of what happened.    
And those responsible shall pay
with their lives.    
Haesten, for one,
is directly responsible for the attack.    
Why do you not seek to punish him?    
Because I'm required here.    
My father, too, will seek retribution
and justice. I am sure.    
Should he live that long.    
    
I pray that he does.    
    
I've found my appetite after all.    
I killed this hare myself with an arrow.    
You are pleased with more
than the hunting of a hare.    
I am.    
Alfred is dead
and I sit opposite a vision of beauty.    
I belong to another.    
He will come.    
Soon, I hope.    
And like this hare...    
will fall by my arrows.    
And then he will avenge me, Lord.    
All of me.    
Who else was witness to this promise?    
Is that important?    
All that matters is that I gave my word.    
 Lord, I was there
with the Lady Aethelflaed, Finan,    
uh, the boy Sihtric, Osferth.    
Some others may have over-heard possibly.    
Father, it is a worthy plan.    
I gave my word to Uhtred...
What you gave was not yours to give!    
 Father...
Say nothing.    
    
Father Beocca,    
inform Uhtred that Edward
has withdrawn his support.    
But I have not.
Lord Uhtred has already left camp.    
Then send a messenger.
Lord King,    
Haesten's our enemy.
Attacking is to our advantage...    
Send a messenger!
It's to my advantage!    
I beg you to listen to me!    
If Haesten is allowed to join
Cnut and Bloodhair, there will be...    
a great battle.    
I'm not ready for such a battle,
nor what will follow.    
 I am not a king.    
Not yet.    
And I fear the aftermath
of a great battle    
will be a challenge too far.    
Lord, I am no warrior, nor strategist.    
But if we can defeat
one-third of a great army    
before it has the opportunity to gather,    
surely that is a good thing.    
We would not be marching
to Beamfleot in support of Uhtred,    
but to protect the kingdom.    
And to delay a greater battle,
and give me time.    
Time to become worthy of your crown.    
You should have approached me.    
But you speak the truth.    
You are not yet ready. Far from it.    
You gave your word without the means
nor ability to keep it.    
    
Perhaps you will never be ready.    
Leave me.    
Father...
I said leave me.    
    
Is it possible to be both proud
and feverish with anger?    
It is often the way, Lord, with children.    
He is his father's son,
of that I have no doubt.    
He can become a man to follow, Lord.    
Given the opportunity.    
    
 Gather your weapon!    
Off your arses now
and gather your weapon!    
Gather your weapon!
 Steapa?    
We march, Lord, to Beamfleot.    
Come on! Make ready. We march!    
Come on! Move yourselves!    
    
It has grown heavier these past weeks.    
I will manage.    
    
God willing, this will be the last
of both Alfred and Edward.    
You disagree, Aldhelm?    
They know my God, Lord.    
The Danes do not.    
Long live the king!    
Long live the king!
    
 Long live the king!    
Long live the king!    
Long live the king!    
Long live the king!    
Long live the king!    
Long live the king!    
Long live the king!    
    
Are you not going with them, my dear?    
My place is in Mercia, Lord.    
    
    
    
    
 You are a lucky man.    
You will go back to Haesten    
and tell him exactly
what you have seen here.    
Agreed?
Yes.    
Yes.    
 Uhtred has finally arrived
to claim you.    
As you said he would.    
With how many men?    
Not more than   .    
That is all?    
 Thirty, fifty.    
All he can do is
try to creep over the walls.    
So when he moves,    
I will have his balls.     
Thirty men is nothing.
He's no longer a lord.    
He has no men, no silver, no land.    
Then be sure to win me, Lord.
    
And be sure to gift me prisoners.    
I have not seen a man beg for mercy
for some time.    
    
    
The great Lord Uhtred and his army.    
Ready the archers
and prepare every last man.    
The Dane-slayer shall die
this very morning.    
 Yes, Lord.    
 Lord Uhtred!    
Such a frightening sight.    
You are a coward, Haesten.    
Hiding inside your fortress.    
When the priests of Eoferwic did rise,
you fled?    
When Sigefrid attacked Alfred, you fled.    
And at the nunnery, once again, you fled.    
I took your woman!    
And as long as I live and breathe,
she still is my woman.    
Fight me!
I'll wait for you in the clearing there.    
Bring a guard and no more.    
Let us make the square
and let the two of us fight.    
 That is what you want, Uhtred,
to die?    
 What I want is an end to this.    
What is most likely to happen
is you will remain a coward.    
You will remain inside your fortress.    
    
Songs will be sung about your cowardice.    
I shall pay for them to be written.
    
I am no coward, Dane-slayer!    
If death is what you want,    
then you shall have it!    
 Lord, the job is done.    
It's been half a day.    
    
Maybe he's scared of the priest.    
We leave!    
 Lord.    
Lord!    
 Lord!    
Lord!    
Run!    
Halt!    
Two lines!    
Shields up!    
Surround them! Give them no escape!    
And then we'll kill every last one
of the bastards!    
 Turn!    
Circle!    
May the good Lord protect me.    
Protect us all.    
We wait.    
We hold!    
We give them no ground!
We've no ground to give, Lord.    
Give up Uhtred,    
and the rest of you will live.    
All I want is the Dane-slayer!    
What you will get, Haesten,
is my sword up your hairy arse.    
    
As you wish.    
You will die on your knees!    
    
Lord, where is Alfred's army?    
Why are they waiting?    
I want the head    
of Uhtred Ragnarson!
    
Stand fast!    
    
    
    
    
 Sihtric! No!    
    
Not one man is to live!    
Turn the field red
with Saxon blood and flesh!    
    
Lord?    
We hold our position.    
They're being slaughtered.    
Lord King, I gave him my word.    
We hold our position.    
    
    
    
    
We cannot just stand by    
and watch them die!
What would Uhtred do?    
He'd allow his enemies
to destroy one another.    
I gave him my word!
Then what will you do, boy?    
You can either bleat
or you can make a decision!    
What will you do?

SEASON: 03
EPISODE: 04
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred. 
I am a Dane for life.  
I have stolen the mystic woman Skade
from the Danish warrior Earl Sigurd. 
She's mine. If I have to kill you,
then that is what I'll do.  
 King Alfred seeks to
protect his legacy, 
but his son, Edward,
refuses an arranged marriage. 
I am married to Ecgwynn.  
Your wife will be dealt with.  
 His daughter,
the Lady of Mercia, 
has fled to a nunnery for safety. 
I have not forgotten what the bitch did.   
I will never forget! 
 I rescued her in the past. 
And now she needs me again. 
The Danes have formed one army
under my brother, Ragnar. 
They plan to march south on Wessex,
leaving me with an impossible choice. 
Do you stand with us?   
I am needed.   
You're a whore to the Crown of Alfred.   
He does not leave with Skade.
She belongs to me.   
Yes, Bloodhair. You can fight
for the witch... to the death.   
Agreed. We fight.   
 Destiny is all!

 Come on, Lord. That's it!   
kill him, Bloodhair!   
 Get him!   
 Come on! kill him!   
Go!   
 kill him!
 Finish him!   
   
   
 Yes, yes! Get him, Lord!   
   
 Get up, Dane-slayer!
 Get up!   
You dirty bastards!   
   
 Come on, Lord! Get his shield!   
Come on!   
   
If you want to play that game!   
You are happy with this, Ragnar?   
You believe this to be a fair fight?   
It's a fight.   
He deserves it. kill him!   
Take his balls!
   
 kill him!   
   
 kill him, Bloodhair!   
Come on!   
 Take his legs off!
 kill him!   
Uhtred! Lord! Here!   
His shoulder!   
   
Yes! Finish him!   
 Yes, Lord.
   
   
   
 What the hell?   
It's over.   
No! It's not over until he's dead.   
I say it is over.   
I demand my woman.   
I will not lose one single man before
the true battle has even begun.   
It was to the death!   
If you disagree with me then fight me.   
kill him, Ragnar, and be done.   
It is over! It is done.   
Take what belongs to you.   
Take your witch.   
She belongs to me!   
I shall see you across the battlefield.
No doubt...   
I will kill you.   
 Leave while you're still alive.   
Alfred needs his ass to be wiped.   
Enjoy your prize.   
You ride with me now.   
 Skade!   
He must remain cursed. It's your duty!   
He has defeated you twice over.   
I belong to Uhtred now.   
Never.   
I've tasted your blood.
What you see is mine!   
Ragnar, he cannot be allowed to leave.   
   
Didn't mean to miss! Next time, I won't.   
The gates! Now.   
Let us be rid of them.   
Earl Ragnar, Lord Cnut.   
Can either of you tell me why
we allowed Uhtred to leave?   
We are gifting Alfred his best warrior.   
What is it you suggest we do?   
I suggest we kill him.   
We can still kill him, all of them.
Apart from your sister.   
But we cannot allow
Uhtred the Dane-slayer   
to return to Wessex and slay more Danes.   
What is your worth?    
It was you who helped
create these events.    
Tell me why not to kill you.    
I am the reason we are gathered here.    
His worth is that he can drip poison
into the ears of Saxons.    
Exactly.    
    
Ragnar!    
 Ragnar!    
Ragnar!    
You drip poison into every ear!    
You smear everything
around you with shit!    
It's Uhtred you're angry with.
He has caused this division.    
Ignore this piece of weasel shit...
    
...and remember, we have a task ahead.    
Cousin, you are our leader now.    
I am hungry for blood and battle!    
Nothing has changed.    
We've lost a handful of men
and nothing more than that.    
    
Nothing has changed.    
We march    
as soon as we're ready.    
Get up.    
He took me by surprise.    
Otherwise, I would have made a contest.
You were right to speak out.    
He should never have been
allowed to leave.    
That was... weak of my cousin.    
    
 Uhtred. Uhtred.    
This is where we must leave you.    
There's a ship waiting at Eoferwic.    
Alfred will be wondering where we are.    
Alfred will know exactly where you are.    
Yes, that is most likely.    
Do not get yourself killed
until Aethelflaed is safe.    
That would be unfortunate.    
It would. And I would have had
a wasted journey.    
Aethelflaed is important to the King
and to all Saxons.    
After she is safe, what then?    
Fate will decide.    
Uhtred. You are my brother...    
and you shall always be my brother.    
 Haesten...    
only you may enter the palace.    
    
You must give up your weapon.    
Earl Haesten.
Lord King.    
It is a considerable journey
you have made.    
A necessary journey.    
Is your wife with you?
I would like to hear of her faith.    
Sadly not, Lady.    
Pity.    
Ale, Lord?    
I know you.    
You're the warrior priest.
I am just a priest.    
Father Pyrlig.    
 You have been
to the north, Haesten.    
 I have, Lord, to Dunholm.    
I journeyed there with Bloodhair,
who remains with Ragnar,    
alongside Uhtred...    
and Aethelwold.    
Aethelwold is there?    
He is.    
No doubt spreading rumor.    
They are building an army, I assume?
They are.    
The plan is to march before deepest
winter makes it impossible.    
They will march    
from north to south as a single army.    
The further south they come,
the greater they will grow.    
They will attract warriors.    
 Hmm, that is true.    
 If it were my place    
to advise you, Lord, I would suggest
you march out to meet them.    
Thank you, Haesten.    
Your loyalty to our agreement
will not go unrewarded.    
Thank you, Lord. Lady.    
Despite Aethelwold's obsessive insolence,    
I did never believe he could turn wholly    
against his father and his homeland.    
And his king.    
It can only mean death.    
Yes.    
Alfred will be thinking of battle
for the weeks to come.    
I want the Lady of Mercia found quickly.    
 Father Pyrlig?    
Lord?    
You will draft and deliver a letter
to my son-in-law, Aethelred.    
You will recount the warning of an army
marching from the north,    
and you will inform him that, together,
we shall face this army...    
at Mercia's most favorable point.    
This is to happen when?
Immediately.    
We cannot wait.    
We shall confront them
and we shall defeat them.    
In the name of God
and the England yet to be.    
Yes, Lord.    
The King speaks and acts
with authority, as always.    
The King fears his strength
shall fail him all too soon.    
Never.    
God is great...    
as is Alfred.    
That is how you will be remembered.    
It is time.    
I will make no proclamations    
except everything is possible.    
I will say nothing more than it is time
to change these lands forever.    
It is time to begin a story    
that will be told amongst the living
and by those in Valhalla forever more.    
It will be our song    
and our story.    
Let it begin.    
Let's move out.    
    
    
My Lady is asking
if you've had enough to eat.    
I've told her yes,    
because the poor nuns have
been in the kitchen all day.    
How about a drop more ale for the night?    
Godric, you have a job to do,    
and you will need to be awake to do it.    
    
    
Abbess, may I ask,
how strong must a woman be    
to live like this for all of her life?
Strong?    
Yes. To deny yourself a life
outside of these walls.    
Lady, we wish to live like this,    
in the service of God.    
I do not regret one day of my time here.
    
 Abbess! Abbess,    
there are men in the kitchen. Danes.    
Close the doors!
Move the table against them. Quickly.    
Why haven't the guards dealt with it?
They will.    
Just as soon as they
become aware of the danger.    
We should call to them.
No!    
If it is thieves, they may come and go.    
    
    
    
This is God's house.    
You will leave us this very moment.    
If you do not and you are Christian,    
then He will send you
to the depths of hell!    
Abbess, they are Danes.    
Well, then, if you are heathen,
He will strike you down!    
 What if I am a Christian
by birth and a Dane by my heart?    
What then?    
 Uhtred.    
Do you think you know this man?    
 Yes.    
Yes, I do.    
Your guards are not, Lady.    
Not what?    
They're not guards.
Their swords are trinkets.    
It's true.
They're good men.    
I'm sure they're loyal,
but they are not guards.    
They are barely men.    
I do not like you, young man.    
You have a very high opinion of yourself.    
I am heathen, I am godless
and an enemy of Alfred...    
but I will keep you alive.    
And who is it that wishes me dead?
Several people, I imagine.    
What Uhtred is saying
is that the lands are changing.    
Men are becoming sick with greed
and we must all be on our guard.    
Well, perhaps.    
But I know when I'm hearing half-truths.    
I do not like him.    
 I like her even less.    
Nor I you, hag.    
    
She reminds me of my mother,
and that woman was never wrong either.    
Cnut!    
Yes, Ragnar?    
Tomorrow, I want men sent on ahead.    
They're to watch for Alfred's army.    
So soon?    
He is no fool. He will not wait for us
to knock on his door.    
He'll want to choose the place of battle,    
and we cannot allow him that advantage.    
We each volunteer a man,
you, me and Bloodhair.    
Yes, Lord.    
Will you speak to Bloodhair, or shall I?    
You.    
Ragnar belittles you.    
He is plowing a new field in the hope
of sowing the seed of another son.    
If you wish to sit with me,
you'll respect me.    
I respect you very much.    
Though I do not wish
to sit with you, Brida,    
I wish to lie with you.    
 You should go while you
still have a tongue in your head.    
I like that you are proud,
and strong and loyal...    
and I will go now.    
Bloodhair.    
A private moment, Lord Sigurd?    
    
 Ragnar requests that
we each send a spy on ahead    
to watch for Alfred.    
That's fair.
It is.    
What was not fair was Ragnar's decision    
to allow your fight with Uhtred
to proceed. That was an insult.    
Skade is yours.    
Ragnar is your cousin.
But this is war.    
Would I trust my sister in command
of my men because she is my sister?    
    
Our spies should also act as messengers.    
They should carry word of our intentions.    
Men will join us, you and me, good men.    
We should grow our armies together.    
Do you agree?    
I do not disagree.    
Then...    
that is enough.    
 I hoped you would come.    
I have released you from your oath,
you do know that?    
Beocca did say.    
And still you are here.    
I was broken to hear of Gisela's death.    
Your father allowed her
to be called a whore.    
I'm sorry for that.    
That was not your doing.    
The woman is still with you, I see.    
Skade.
She is my curse.    
My problem to resolve.    
She is no longer a prisoner?
She will not stray.    
You are carrying so much pain.    
Do not give your trust to a person
who does not deserve it,    
regardless of her guile and beauty.    
You are speaking of Skade still?    
It is not my business to ask,
but do you lie with her?    
I do not.    
She has a darkness.    
My immediate concern is your safety.    
You must return to
Wessex, to your father.    
I can't. I am of Mercia now...
Aethelflaed, you must.    
Aethelred will soon know
that you're close.    
The real danger you will face
is from the Danes.    
They are marching as we speak,
a great army.    
Haesten is with them.    
He has not forgotten you,    
and I cannot protect you forever.    
I will not fight against the Danes.    
Alfred must protect you now...
Shh.    
You are here and I am glad of it.    
Soon I shall travel to my estate,    
and I shall face
both my husband and the Danes.    
I shall fight.    
I must...    
as my father must.    
He, too, shall march.
Aethelflaed...    
If you will excuse me, I promised
the Abbess I would pray with her.    
There is much to pray for.    
    
There should be no doubts
in your mind, Lord.    
Once you have fulfilled your promise
to the princess,    
you must return to your own path,
to the Danes.    
And they would have me?
They would need you, Uhtred Ragnarson.    
If that is who you are,
then you must return and you must lead.    
And you will need Skade, the seer,
to help you lead.    
It is not a seat I want.    
I have made my choice, Uhtred.
Now you must do the same.    
Make your life your own once more.    
Turn away from me,
and you and those you love    
shall be tormented till death and beyond.    
Lord Aethelhelm has arrived.    
A good choice, I feel.    
Yes.    
He has quite a gathering with him.    
Oh, he likes to show his feathers.    
But he has money and men,
both of which I will need.    
A perfect choice.    
He must not witness me sickly.    
 Lord.    
On behalf of King Alfred
and Lady Aelswith, welcome to Winchester.    
The King is with Edward...
I do not recall your name.    
I am Beocca.    
Father Beocca, an adviser to the King.    
My rooms are in the palace?    
They are not, Lord.    
They are the most comfortable rooms
available at the inn.    
An alehouse?
Yes, Lord.    
And if my daughter were with me,    
would she too be expected
to rest in an alehouse?    
But she is not, Lord.    
The palace is under repair.    
In my experience,
Roman walls rarely need repair.    
You will inform Alfred I did
expect a room at the palace.    
I can find my own way to an alehouse,
Father. You are dismissed.    
Yes, Lord.    
And may you choke on your oysters...
What was that?    
The oysters, Lord.    
They are a delight.    
We are to march in one
week, less perhaps.    
And I will have this matter settled.    
What do you say, Edward?    
I have looked to God as you asked,    
and it is before God
that I did swear my love.    
I say I am married already.
Then you shall unmarry!    
It is as simple as that.    
As you clearly lack the courage
to take this step...    
Father, to remain married is honorable.    
Edward, you'll say nothing more.    
Bishop Erkenwald?    
Lord, the girl in question has chosen
to enter a nunnery.    
No, no. She has not, she would not...
She has given herself to God...    
That's not true!
...so, the marriage,    
if it did exist at all, can be dismissed.    
I wish to see her. I wish to...    
What you wish, Edward,
is of no importance! None.    
The father of your match
has both wealth and men.    
You will do your duty!
I do not wish to do my...    
Do you believe that I wished
for my brother to be killed in battle...    
and for the crown to be
placed upon my head?    
I did not.    
But I soon realized that as
well as it being a burden,    
it is a privilege    
to lead our people.    
The crown of Wessex is all-important.    
Wessex and England are all-important.    
Matters of the heart are not.    
She would not have entered
a nunnery by choice.    
Unless she cares more
for her God and country    
than for the son of the King.    
You are to be betrothed.    
And in good time,
you shall marry Aelflaed.    
Father Pyrlig, the holy relics.
My son will now swear.    
Saint Cuthbert's teeth, Lord,
or something kinder?    
The teeth are appropriate, Father.    
What of my children?    
The children will be cared for.
But not by their mother.    
Of course not by their mother.
She now belongs to God.    
 The children will thrive...    
but first there is a bargain to be made
and a battle to be won.    
If the battle is not won,
the children shall become slaves,    
and their mother, a Viking's whore.    
The crown is all-important.    
Do you understand?    
I... I do.    
We go slowly and we rest often.    
To remain strong.
The battle cannot begin without us.    
That is true.    
I would like to ask
in all seriousness and confidence...    
Do I have your confidence?    
Of course. Speak freely.    
In confidence, then, I ask,
is Ragnar the man to lead our army?    
Uhtred did suggest him,
but Uhtred is gone.    
Uhtred has betrayed us.
My point exactly.    
So is your cousin the man
to lead our army?    
Cnut, I was...
I was talking friend-to-friend,    
nothing more than hypothesizing.    
I do not know what that word means,
but I will say this in confidence.    
Ragnar is a good man.    
His father, the Fearless,
was a better man.    
Ragnar's whole purpose in life
has been to avenge him.    
He did that by killing Kjartan.
I was there.    
Which he has done, yes.    
Hence, no more purpose.    
Once again, I find it difficult to
disagree with you, Aethelwold.    
Ragnar is spent.    
That said, he will kill you.    
What? Why?
He blames you for losing Uhtred.    
Why? I merely opened his eyes.
And he will close yours, for all time.    
I like you, Aethelwold,
but Ragnar will kill you.    
Soon.    
    
    
In the name of Alfred, King of Wessex,
I'm taking these children.    
No. You can't!
They'll become church property    
and dedicate their lives
to the worship of God.    
    
You are Ecgwynn?    
She is.
Yes.    
You are required in Winchester.    
He will ask of his precious daughter.    
And you can tell him Aethelflaed is well.    
Lord, if a Dane army is fast approaching,    
then there is only one path to take.    
To join Alfred.    
To join him and to preserve Mercia.    
    
Then we shall fight, Aldhelm.    
And with luck, the right
people shall die.    
    
    
Ugh. They are ravenous, permanently.
Take them through.    
They're eating into our winter store
and belching it out into the air.    
Right.    
There you are. There.    
Hey, there.    
That'll fatten you up nicely, hey?    
Good girls.    
 Good morning, nun!    
I am an abbess.    
 I don't care.    
    
We will wait...    
for Aethelflaed!    
To the hall, all of you, quickly, now!    
That's it.    
Come on.    
 What is it?
Abbess?    
Danes. Outside.    
I just witnessed them kill a man.    
How many Danes?
I did not count them, but many.    
Why aren't they bursting in?    
Finan, hold. Sihtric.
They may not know we're here.    
They have asked for the lady Aethelflaed.    
They know someone is here.    
There are two other hostages.    
We wait inside and will remain silent.    
Abbess, you will go to them
and talk to them.    
No, no, I... I... I will not.    
You will, because you must.    
 Did I not say I do not like you?
You did.    
Allow them to believe you are unprotected    
and deny Aethelflaed is here.    
And we will do what, hide?
We will make an advantage out of this.    
Abbess, the hostages they have
are dead men breathing.    
You cannot save them.    
What we must do now is save the lives
of your nuns and my men.    
And Aethelflaed.
Abbess?    
Aye.
I will do it.    
No.    
No. This is my house,
it's my responsibility.    
I will do it.     
    
It is Haesten, with no more than    men.    
Forty that I can see.    
Then let us fight them.
No, wait.    
What is it you want?    
We have some food and some ale,
it is yours.    
What we do not have is silver.    
If it is ourselves you want, our lives...    
I ask you, why?    
Aethelflaed!    
Aethelflaed, Aethelflaed, Aethelflaed...    
How many times
do I have to say that stupid name?    
What I want is Aethelflaed!    
Give her to me now...    
or this man dies.    
 No! No, no!    
There is no one in this house
called Aethelflaed.    
    
    
Deny her presence once more
and a third man dies.    
And I will burn down your nunnery
and everyone inside.    
Release him.    
Release him and take me
in his place.     
Or am I too strong for you?    
    
    
Why must you behave like this?    
Why must you slaughter
for no good reason?    
 Dagfinn.    
Aethelflaed.
Why must blood be spilled?    
It is heathen!    
Ungodly!    
And you are the devil's incarnation,
nothing more!    
    
And all I can try and do is ensure that    
He shall have you.
    
    
    
    
Could you not just have taken
the ax from her hand?    
 Lord, now?    
We do nothing... yet.    
 Aethelflaed!    
Enough men and women have died
to save your bony arse...    
at Beamfleot and now here.    
Did my lord Erik
not give his life for you?    
How many more must do the same?    
Show yourself!    
    
There are many horses at the stab.    
Why have her other men
not shown themselves?    
Because like the men we just killed,    
they are busy filling their breeches.    
Aethelflaed!    
She's here!    
    
    
    
    
    
    
That's it.    
It was Uhtred!
I saw who it was.    
Why is he not in the north?
Because he is here!    
We block every entrance,
but not the main doors.    
And we wait!    
We are trapped.    
We're alive...    
and they are    or    men less.    
But we are trapped under a wooden roof.    
What do you suggest then, Lady?    
That you give yourself over?
Yes.    
Haesten's right. Why should I live
when so many others have died?    
Haesten has never
spoken the truth in his life!    
Do not say as much again. Never.    
Or those men have died for no reason.    
Your men have arrived
at the River Ouse, I'm told.    
That was the message.    
That is good news.    
We will rise early tomorrow
and quicken our pace.    
Why expend our strength?    
The first battle is always in the mind.    
Alfred'll have his spies.    
When they see us,
I want Bloodhair's men alongside with us.    
I want us to be a swarm, one army.    
Then we will rise early
and quicken our pace.    
What of Haesten?    
I expect him to keep his word
and protect us from the east,    
attack from the east.    
Only when we have sight
of the enemy in battlefield    
can we discuss exactly how we fight.    
 Agreed.    
Are you away to sow another seed, cousin?    
I'm away to my bed, Cnut.
Alone?    
 Ragnar.    
Again?    
Yes.    
It's the last time, I promise.    
One more son.    
I swear.    
If it's not, I'll take your cock.    
I swear.    
Aethelwold, my friend.    
How are you?    
Alive still, which is good.     
I have been thinking on what you said...    
about Ragnar and the likelihood
of him killing me.    
Soon.    
Yes, soon. Thank you for reminding me.    
    
I was thinking that perhaps...    
I should kill him first.    
Is that a plan at all?    
At least you are not laughing
at the idea.     
How?    
How would you kill him?    
In his sleep. I'm not gonna fight him.    
When?
Soon.    
Sooner than he kills me.     
Tonight?
Tonight?    
I don't know,
the idea's only just come to me.    
It should be tonight.    
Tomorrow we quicken our pace.    
Tomorrow we begin to think about
the battle ahead.    
Tomorrow, Ragnar will become
a different man.    
Once it is done...    
you will have my protection, friend.    
Very well.    
Tonight.    
The ale is good.
Yeah, it is.    
Very good.    
To the creators of fine ale!    
    
May God... bless them.    
May the gods bless them. Him.    
All doors have been blocked
on the outside apart from that one.    
Will they set a fire?    
Not yet. He will want you alive.    
We should fight, Lord.
We should open the doors and fight.    
And die?
It's as good a plan as any.    
Osferth, you'll open the door
on my word and retreat.    
We form a shield wall
and then we negotiate.    
Negotiate?    
Haesten will want his prize.    
To the door!    
If you truly belong to me...    
you will do as I ask.    
In return,    
I will not abandon you.    
I will come for you.    
You're choosing her over me?
I am keeping us alive.    
By making me a prize.
I will not abandon you.    
I will lie with you.    
You shall remain cursed
until your word is made true.    
Your life shall wither, Uhtred,
until you find me.    
And I will find you.    
Shield wall ready!    
    
Lord, there is something happening.    
Every man at the ready.    
Every sword!    
Lift the bar and open the door.    
Move!    
    
I count a few more than thirty
of the bastards.    
Fight, Haesten, and you will lose men.    
Many men, I guarantee it.
I have many men.    
 But you have just the one life!    
And I plan to take it.    
Move out!    
    
Dagfinn! Easy, easy!    
    
I will not leave without her, Uhtred.    
I may lose men,
but you will lose everything,    
and the bitch will still be mine.    
Then take her,
because that is what you will have to do.    
Or we can strike a bargain.    
One woman in place of another.    
I am in no need of a nun.    
Who is this woman?
Skade. The seer.    
Finan.    
She is yours.    
In return, you and your men
ride clear of this place    
and do not return.    
She is not yours to give.    
She belongs to Bloodhair.
I belong to the man I choose.    
The man who has the will to lead,
to conquer.    
Bloodhair is not that man.    
 She has seen Alfred's death...
and in battle.    
Her man will benefit
from that death, greatly.    
Is this true?    
It's true.    
May I approach?    
Uhtred, you cannot bargain
with this sack of chicken shit.    
You're close enough.    
If a bargain is made, I will not be
handed over like you would a whore.    
I will walk to my new Lord.    
And should either man
go back on his word,    
I shall see he is tormented till the end.    
I swear.    
Do we have an agreement?
Skade in place of Aethelflaed?    
    
Agreed.    
The seer is mine.    
Then step back and she will walk to you.    
And then you leave.
I will.    
And you are cursed once more,
Uhtred of Bebbanburg.    
You shall wither!    
Go.    
Open, let her pass.    
This does not mean the princess
is forgiven, Uhtred.    
She is safe for now, no more than that.    
Leave. Go.    
Your life is not your own, Lord.    
Lord.    
Aethelhelm.    
How good of you to join me.    
I thought it fitting that
our first meeting should be at prayers.    
My Lord King, it's an honor to be asked.    
And this, if I am not mistaken,
must be Edward?    
Lord.    
I too am happy to see you
here at Winchester.    
I look forward to meeting
your daughter, Aelflaed,    
but only at a time that you think fit,
of course.    
 Charming.    
Aethelhelm, I shall bring you
into my confidence immediately.    
war is coming.    
Your lands are under threat.    
Danes are marching in numbers
from north to south.    
Let us pray for the strength and
fortitude to defeat them once again.    
Join me.    
    
    
    
 I am... to my bed.    
Good night! Good night!    

    
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SEASON: 03
EPISODE: 03
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred. 
My Gisela has died in childbirth,
killed by our newborn son. 
The King's health, it worsens.  
 King Alfred
has little time left to him 
and his enemies are swarming,
intent on power. 
What I want
is your disloyalty towards Alfred.  
 But his heir, Edward,
is not ready to succeed. 
threat the King
and now banished from Wessex, 
I have fled back to my true family... 
I am a Dane for life.   
...making traitors of my men
loyal to Wessex. 
I did not come here
to talk of war against Alfred.   
 I have stolen a seer, Skade, 
from the Danish warrior, Earl Sigurd. 
She was my prize,
but she holds me under her spell. 
The world is in crisis, 
and Alfred's daughter,
the Lady of Mercia, 
is threat by her own husband.
I want her dead.   
It would be of great comfort
to know that I could call upon you again.   
 Destiny is all. 
   
   
You cannot escape who you are, arseling.   
Blood and bone, you are Bebbanburg.   
   
 Lord.   
What is it, Osferth?   
Forgive me, Lord, I have not said.   
I loved her, Lady Gisela.   
I mean, not as you loved her, but...   
She was always kind to me, Lord.   
Always.   
I'll pray for her soul,
if that's acceptable.   
It is, Osferth. Thank you.   
You have made him a traitor.   
He's made his choice...   
and I have made mine.   
You made no choice.   
If you had not killed the monk,
you would still be Alfred's oathman.   
Then I'm glad I killed the monk.   
I am Dane.   
Have you finished your food, Lady?
I have. Thank you.   
Reading in candlelight
will cost you your eyes.   
There is a thegn requesting to fell
three large trees from my land   
to help build a new hall.   
You grant him three trees, Lady,   
and he invites you to share food
with him and his wife.   
Then he'll wield you...
   
...telling everyone
that you and him are the best of friends.   
Unless he's paying you handsomely,
your trees deserve better.   
   
   
Lady, do not make a sound.
I mean you no harm.   
It is Aldhelm.
No one can know why I've come.   
I'll say what needs to be said
and then I'll leave. I swear.   
I will take my hand away.   
By all means, hold it,
but I beg you do not use it.   
Then speak.
Make it quick and make it plain. Speak.   
Lady, you must leave. For your
own safety, you must leave Mercia.   
Tell me why I must leave.
Your husband wants to kill you.   
He wants you killed,
and blame rogues for it.   
He would never...
It's true. Why else would I say it?   
To have me leave voluntarily?
No.   
Have me killed here,
then it could be rogues.   
Lady, no.   
Why else would you tell me?
You have never been a friend.   
You are my husband's hound.   
All of which is true.
To say otherwise would be a lie.   
And it is not the time for lies.   
I am here because I am a Mercian.   
And 'cause I believe
that we would be a poorer land   
without the Lady of Mercia.   
You have a suitor's tongue.   
I cannot believe you, and I will not.   
You have no reason to,   
but I swear on my life and to God,
it is true.   
If I run and then return,
my father by my side?   
Again, I beg you, do not.   
Mercia needs Wessex.
Alliances must not alter.   
And Wessex too is changing.
Your father weakens,   
and Uhtred, he has fled north a traitor.   
No, that is a lie. He would never.
Uhtred would never break an oath.   
What else would have him dare
to kill you? One has followed the other.   
I am here for Mercia.   
Believe me, I speak the truth.   
Then you have betrayed my husband.   
Only you and I know about this.   
I shall remain at his side.   
He is of Mercia
and he is no coward on the battlefield,   
but he is not the king
I hoped he would become.   
Nor the husband you deserve.   
I shall leave now, quietly,   
and you must do the same,   
for the sake of the land we both love.   
Lord Aldhelm... you have my thanks.   
Lady.   
   
Forgive me, Godric, for dragging you
and your men from your beds.   
We are headed to the
nunnery at Wincelcumb    
for a short period of
prayer, that is all.    
For your father?    
Yes.    
Though I shall ensure
there is ale and good food.    
Nothing more you wish to tell us?    
There is not.    
Thank you.    
Sable, the letters. You know what to do.    
I do, Lady.    
God will be with you.    
See no one but Father Beocca.    
Yes, Lady.    
You have the will of a queen.    
My entire life as king
shall be recorded within this chronicle.    
On my table
is a list of possible wives for Edward.    
I would like your opinion.    
Yes, of course, Lord,
though I am no expert.    
These are the names
of ealdormen and thegns, Lord.    
Does each man have a daughter?    
I don't know. That's
for you to establish.    
The thegns are all of
Cent and Wiltunscir.    
The bride must be of the lower lands.    
We must undo the damage
done by Edward and his...    
errant behavior.    
Behavior that is to be expected    
from a young man, Lord.
Wessex...     
Wessex must remain united.    
Is My Lord feeling unwell?    
My Lord must part company
with the little he had for his breakfast.    
You will excuse me.    
I will attend to the matter
of suitors, of brides, Lady.    
It is not the daughter
we are choosing, Father Beocca.    
It is her father and his standing.    
You will choose Aethelhelm.
Lord Aethelhelm.    
He is an ealdorman of Wiltunscir.    
His purse is full,    
his fyrd numbers one
thousand men or more,    
and fortunately, his daughter
is both fair and in good health.    
The King will approve.
He will?    
Send for Aethelhelm.    
Visit him if you must,
but do not dwell on the matter.    
Beocca. Father Beocca.    
Forgive the intrusion.
Um, I need to unburden.    
It is Edward.
What of him?    
Well, he claims to be married already.    
Married by whom?    
Who carried out this ceremony?    
It was a priest.    
I suspect your son
is playing a game, Lord.    
 It's no game.    
Lord, I could not ignore
what he has disclosed.    
I am married to Ecgwynn.     
I can only suggest
that we ask the girl directly.    
You cannot do that.
She is gentle and delicate.    
Neither of which prevented you    
from jumping upon her
at the first opportunity.    
You either give me the name of the priest    
or I send for your delicate whore.
Which will it be?    
I will say nothing more.    
Edward, you will do as
your king commands.    
Or you will have me killed?    
You will hold your tongue.    
And remember that you are the aetheling.    
And what if I do not wish to become king?
It is your duty!    
Bishop Erkenwald, you will escort
the future king of Wessex    
to the nearest monastery    
where he shall pray every hour of the day    
and night...
I wish to remain at the palace.    
...until God makes him realize    
that being king is not a pastime,
not a choice, but a duty.    
    
Your wife will be dealt with.    
You shall never dare put at risk
all that I have achieved.    
 News, Lord.    
Lord.
Well?    
The house was empty. No persons there.    
The Lady Aethelflaed is gone.    
There is not so much as a servant
or... or a guard, Lord.    
    
She must have been forewarned...    
by you.    
Lord, you cannot simply
execute your subjects as you please.    
This is the ninth century.    
She has gone where?    
It is too late to ask him.    
Are you laughing at me?    
I am not, Lord.    
But maybe it's for the best
that Aethelflaed lives.    
The best for whom?    
When Alfred eventually decides to depart,    
we must be made welcome in Winchester.    
Otherwise...
You'll find out where she is    
and ensure she is dispatched.    
You should leave her in her peace, Lord.
That is my advice.    
Find her    
and give her circumstance and
whereabouts to the Danes, any Dane.    
Yes, Lord.
    
Why are you not dead yet?    
You, finish him.    
You are done for, my friend.
    
As we may all be done for.    
 We are divided, it seems.    
We are two people...    
it seems.    
    
Over here, we have the ugly...    
    
...the unwashed...    
the shit-smelling...    
the pig-humping...    
frog-licking...
Frog-licking?    
...the Rome-worshipping...    
ugly, frog-licking Saxons!    
    
That is who we are!    
But we do not lick frogs.    
They face, in a battle of strength...    
the pretty...
    
...the sweet-smelling...
Whoo-hoo!    
...the light-of-foot...
Apple-cheeked!    
...the apple-cheeked,    
golden-haired boys of Denmark and beyond!    
    
Ragnar, you are a skald, not a warrior.    
I have the gift, I really do.    
Now, you may take the rope.    
 Come on, let's do this! Come on.    
Look at him, he loves it.    
Are you prepared?
He'd play games every day if he could.    
Is there spit in your hands?    
Good earth beneath your feet?    
Come on! Get on with it, Ragnar.    
 Let's do this!    
Pull!
    
 Saxons! Pull!
    
 Pull! Pull!    
Are you a Dane? Pull!
Yes!    
You never tire of this game.    
If only all wars were fought this way!    
Pull, you bastards!    
    
    
Ragnar, son of the fearless,
is the victor!    
    
He brings    men on their arse
while drinking ale!    
    
You are life itself.
    
Ragnar!    
We're playing games, can't you see that?    
Ragnar, it is the watchman.    
The gate, open it.    
 Ragnar?    
My watchmen do not return for no reason.    
What is it?
Men and horses, Lord.    
Warriors.
How many?    
Forty or fifty. I don't recognize them.    
Spears and arrows to the walls    
till we know who they are,
what they want.    
Hold your aims.
Finan.    
Bar the gate.    
    
    
    
He is here.    
He is here and I will refuse him.    
They are Danes.    
 Hmm.
Yes.    
 Definitely.    
I recognize one of them. Two of them.    
It is Haesten and Bloodhair.    
 The Earl Sigurd?    
Neither are fond of me.    
For what reason, I wonder.    
 Earl Ragnar, I am Haesten.    
 We know who you are.
The question is, what do you want?    
Shelter, food, ale, warmth
and negotiation, perhaps.    
Negotiation? Are we at war?    
 It is what we do, Lord.    
Discussion would be a better word.    
 You are a long way
from Beamfleot, Haesten.    
Uhtred?    
Believe me, it could be
a pleasure to see you here.    
So it is true.    
You are no longer Alfred's oathman.    
It is true.    
And you? Are you still Alfred's oathman?    
 He believes so.    
And Earl Sigurd, Bloodhair,
what do you have to say?    
I say we're tired and hungry
and my arse is sore.    
You can't refuse them, Ragnar.    
Do you have anything
to say to me, Bloodhair?    
Last time I saw you,
you were running for your life.    
Yes. You took what belongs to me.
We have that matter to settle.    
 It is settled.    
It can wait.
It may even be resolved peacefully.    
Brida is right, we cannot refuse them.    
You leave your swords at the gate.
You have our respect.    
There will be no argument, I swear.    
 Open the gate.    
 Open the gate!    
They are here for one thing only,
to speak of war and of Alfred.    
Lord. Aethelwold.    
Uhtred. I was just about to find you.
    
What is it you believe you are doing?    
You know what I'm doing.
Mmm?    
I'm seizing a chance
to take what is mine,    
an opportunity.    
Aethelwold, you are here for amusement
and nothing else.    
Your rightful place
is the alehouse in Winchester.    
Don't dare believe you're above that.    
I am as much King of Wessex
as you are Lord of Bebbanburg.    
Both of us usurped by an uncle.    
I won't let this chance pass...    
Where is your honor?    
You are meant to be
the son of a king of Wessex.    
You do not belong here.    
My crown was stolen, and thanks to you,    
I now have the opportunity
to take it back.    
Make no mistake,
we are the same, you and I.    
Apparent traitors to Wessex,
but for good cause.    
We are not the same and never shall be.    
There is no backward step, my friend,
for either of us.    
Birds have flown, horses have bolted.    
Kings will be made and kings will die.    
Because of you.    
Lord...    
I am leaving for home and for my bed.    
Are there any other matters?    
Sleep well, Lord.
Uhtred's children.    
He has abandoned them?    
No, Lord, not quite.    
The Abbess Hild is providing
for the children.    
Coccham is no longer their place.    
It is no longer Uhtred's estate.
It is no longer home to his seed.    
Have them brought to Winchester...    
arrange for their welfare and education.    
Introduce them to God.    
Rest well, Father Beocca.    
Yes, Lord. Rest well.    
    
 Go on, move!
    
You will not believe what Alfred
has asked me.    
Beocca, this is Sable.    
She has news of Aethelflaed.
    
She is safe, you say?
 She is.    
She has gone to the
nunnery at Wincelcumb.    
To be guarded
by Mercia's most fierce nuns.    
The King must not know.    
But if we say nothing to the King,
if we withhold the knowledge    
of a threat to Aethelflaed's life,
that's treachery.    
It is what My Lady wishes.    
It is what she wishes, not I.    
Father, she does not want
the King disturbed, for good reason.    
Nor the bond between
our two lands broken.    
I understand her wanting Wessex
and Mercia to remain allies.    
But if talk of the King's illness
is emboldening,    
creating enemies of Wessex,
we can't stand by.    
Father, will you help us?    
We will.    
How? By doing what?    
By traveling to the nunnery myself?    
 There is a second letter.    
I'm to give it to you only if you agree    
with My Lady's reasoning
for not telling the King.    
It is a solution.    
He is always the solution, it seems.    
What?    
Aethelflaed has arranged a ship.
It is waiting for us on the Temes.    
She thinks it will be
both quicker and safer.    
To take us where?    
To take us north, dear. To the solution.    
    
    
How are your guests,
the apple-cheeked Danes?    
 They are eating my food
and drinking my ale.    
Have they asked for your sword yet?    
They too are saying Alfred is near death,    
and that he is preparing his son
for the crown.    
True.    
His son is a boy    
and Alfred is without his commander.    
 Again, true.    
Our grandfather would often
speak of Wessex,    
about its rich and fertile land
from the Temes to the sea.    
Valhalla in this life.
 Yes.    
"Valhalla in this life."
Yes, he said that.    
How proud would he be    
if together we marched
a great army, and we took that land?    
He would be proud, no doubt.    
You...    
you have made this possible.    
By abandoning Alfred...    
by leaving Wessex,
you have made this possible.    
It is fate, no doubt.    
You would kill me, arseling?     
And men like me?    
Leave us.
Lord, I cannot.    
Brida would have my balls.    
You have recovered, Lord. I'm glad.    
What is it you want of me? My life?    
To be a part of your life, yes.    
To live beside you and through you.    
You will never be rid of me.    
Accept it.    
Accept me.    
What will become of Wessex and Alfred?    
Alfred will die and with him his kingdom,    
his god, his people.    
Wessex will become just another song.    
Danes shall rule.    
But you, Uhtred Ragnarson...    
For that is who you are now.    
...it is you who must rule.    
For the sake of the Saxons
you must take Alfred's place.    
Only you can unite the two tribes.    
What Alfred could only wish for
can be yours.    
Ours, My Lord...    
My king.    
What I want is to be your queen.    
And this heart can be yours,
should you want it.    
    
She belongs to me. You will return her.    
You gave her up to save yourself.
 She's mine.    
If I have to kill you,
then that is what I will do.    
Right here.    
You are a guest of my brother,
so I will ignore you this once.    
But threat me again
and I'll feed your guts to the pigs.    
 Do nothing, Lord,
or I will take your throat.    
No lie.    
Skade is mine.    
Do nothing. I beg you.    
You do not understand.    
She's not a woman to own.    
It is she that must own a part of you.    
Her blood becomes your blood.    
We will speak again, I'm certain.    
Thank you, Lord.    
You are mine to kill.    
    
Ragnar, I have given you my word
that I would keep the peace,    
but I wish to fight Uhtred.    
He has taken my woman, my seer.    
He shames me. I'd like
to slit his belly...    
Now is not the time.    
I would accept a fight of skill,
with staffs. Skade as the prize.    
Bloodhair...    
now is not the time.    
My answer is no.    
    
 I despise every moment
I am upon the waters.    
If God intended I travel the seas,
he'd have made me a fish.    
Or a Dane.    
I pray we are not risking our lives
in this storm for no reason.    
This is no storm.    
My mother and I
came to this land on a ship    
that lost half of its crew to the sea.    
Waves taller than a barn
swept them to their death.    
This is not a story I wish to hear.    
The real storm you will face
will come at Dunholm.    
    
And I will return south    
and send Bloodhair's men and ships
to the River Ouse.    
You will follow,
and together we attack Mercia,    
we attack Wessex...
    
...and we kill Alfred!
    
I find the pretty Aethelflaed...    
and we all take our turn with her.
    
We count our silver.
We go from north to south,    
east to west,
taking everything in our path.    
And at some point,
we begin to fight amongst ourselves,    
and the plan fails.    
Fight? For what reason?    
It will happen.    
It will surely happen.    
Why? Because you say it?    
'Cause each of you
believes himself to be the sword Dane    
above all others, mistakenly.    
There can be only one leader.    
I will lead. I have ships, I have men.    
I've not grown lazy
sitting inside a fortress...    
Are you are calling me lazy?    
I am asking you to join me, Ragnar,
as Haesten has joined me.    
When did I join you?    
I gave you food.
I did not give you my oath.    
You believe you should lead?
Yes.    
Why not?
Name your victories.    
Says the man who lost half his army
to a sickly king.    
That is enough of the shit talk.    
Next, you'll compare cock sizes.
    
There can only be one leader.
It must be you, Ragnar.    
Why? 'Cause he's your brother?    
Because Ragnar's the only man
each of us will trust.    
The only man.    
You do not trust me, Dane-slayer?    
Don't know you or like you.    
But you are Ragnar's cousin.    
It's not about who leads,
it's about how the wealth is divided.    
We do not talk of wealth
until we have it in our hands.    
Uhtred says that we must become one army.    
I see no man here fool
enough to disagree.    
You all know of me.    
You know of my father and my grandfather.    
And I tell you now, I would be proud
to lead the next great army,    
but only if it is agreed
by each one of you.    
In return for your trust,
I give you my word.    
When Alfred is defeated,
and he will be defeated...    
...there will be silver,    
but more than that...    
there will be reputation and honor
in this life and the next.    
So, who is with me?    
Bloodhair?    
Yes. I'm with you.    
You have my sword. I swear.    
Haesten?    
I have no argument. I, too, will follow.    
And me, cousin, always,
but you knew that.    
And me.    
I'm a man who knows    
every Saxon grudge and grievance
held against Alfred.    
And there are many.    
You will need me.    
That leaves Uhtred.    
My sword is my brother's, no doubt.    
Then it is settled.    
The kingdom of Wessex will surrender.    
    
Or burn!    
    
We cannot go against the men of Wessex.    
Be quiet.
 They're our people.    
Finan, our friends.
Osferth, be quiet.    
    
    
    
Now my sword.    
    
 If you'll allow...
Leave us now.    
My Lady. My Lord.    
Lord, why are you doing this to yourself?
There is peace.    
There is doubt, my dear.    
It is infecting all of our England.    
This may yet be a weight
that I must carry.    
That I will carry, God help me.    
    
I must know that I am able. And I am.    
I am.    
I pray you are wrong...    
but I know the sight of you alone    
would strike at the heart
of both the doubters and heathen.    
Alfred...    
you will never leave me.    
    
 Beocca, you have
not spoken a word the whole day.    
 Yes, I have.    
Though my mind is occupied.    
Dunholm...    
I should not be taking you back
to such a place.    
I worry the memories will overwhelm you.    
It was a different life, Beocca.    
I am a different woman.    
I'm with you always.    
 Riders.    
We should hide ourselves.    
Haesten.    
What is he doing in the north,
such a long way from Beamfleot?    
    
What is it?
Traders, maybe.    
One man, one woman.
Unbar the gates.    
Let us take a look at them.    
A part of me had hoped
he would not be here.    
Thyra.    
Thyra, what are you doing here?    
Are you not glad to see me?    
Look at you, you're beautiful.    
And you're smiling.
 I am happy.    
What a sight you are.
You have come all this way.    
 To see you.
Who is he here to see?    
Brida, I see you've swallowed
yet another wasp.    
Beocca insisted on accompanying me.    
That is true, in part.    
I am also here
to carry out the King's order    
and formally banish Uhtred from Wessex.    
Such an order is required by law.    
When Thyra has grown tired
of her brothers' company,    
we shall be gone.    
You came all this way
to tell Uhtred what he already knows?    
To see the boy one last time.
Kick his arse, perhaps.    
Is it true?
All of it.    
Thyra.    
Good to see you.    
My children, are they well?
Have you heard?    
They are well
and they are being cared for.    
I will fetch them soon.    
I'll let you rest.    
I will speak with the priest later.    
    
This priest, he is your happiness?    
He is.    
I could not be without him.    
Nor I, you.    
We did see the, uh,
charming Earl Haesten on the road.    
I know him from his visits to Winchester.    
Is he an ally to you,
as well as to Alfred?    
Haesten is a Dane.    
Indeed.    
As is Uhtred.    
Father Beocca...    
Welcome to Dunholm.    
 Comes as no surprise
to see you here.    
Amongst friends.    
    
Finan.
Father Beocca.    
It's good to see you.
 Osferth.    
Dane boy, looks like a rat.
I am Sihtric.    
Your wife, Sihtric, she has left Coccham    
and returned to the inn at Winchester.    
She has? Is she well?    
Oh, she is well.    
And she is loud.
    
 Some privacy?
Sit yourself down, Father.    
We all need to piss.    
What is all this?    
You seem to be preparing for battle.    
It is not your concern.    
I fear it may become my concern
quite soon.    
    
Give your message and be on your way.    
Please, say it.    
I am not here to chide
you or to save you,    
and I'm not here for Alfred.    
I'm here for Aethelflaed.
She's in hiding in a nunnery.    
Hiding from who?
Her husband.    
He plans to have her killed.    
This is not my worry.    
She has guards, she has the King,    
she has Steapa too.
She's asked for Uhtred.    
    
Did Aethelwold journey here alone?    
He arrived with Haesten and Bloodhair.    
Having first paid a visit to Aethelred.    
Yes. That is what he did.    
Am I to assume the plan is to make
Aethelwold the next king of Wessex?    
    
If Haesten is returning south,    
then soon he will know
where Aethelflaed is hiding.    
Beocca, I have given
half my life to Wessex.    
I will give no more.
She says you are sworn to her.    
That you promised to help her
should her husband threat her.    
This is a trick. This is Alfred's doing.    
Aethelflaed hereby releases you
from that oath.    
Yes.    
She asks for your help
not because you are her oathman, Uhtred,    
but because you are the man
that she trusts the most.    
I will say no more.    
Had I remained in Wessex
and refused to swear to Edward,    
Alfred would have had me killed.    
It was for Aethelflaed that I came here.    
You're free to choose your own path.    
May God bless you and guide you.    
    
Say nothing.    
I won't so much as fart
in your direction, Lord.    
I'll simply say to Sihtric here
that this great army    
we're supposedly gathering
can never hold.    
Agreed.    
And I'll mention to Osferth
that I didn't come north    
only to turn and march south.    
Nor me, Finan.    
Lord, I will follow you wherever you go,
but I have a wife in Wessex.    
And men like Haesten and Bloodhair
are no better than Kjartan.    
If the north is your home,
your birthright,    
then why are we not looking
towards Bebbanburg?    
Now that is a fight we can believe in.    
Uhtred... I am begging you
as your friend, do not do this.    
We should leave this place.    
And abandon my brother?    
How can I do that?    
You must.    
When Alfred was young,
he would hump anything and everything,    
I swear.    
He could not help himself.
Or rather, he could,    
and he did.
    
Uhtred.    
What did you say to Aethelred?    
What? What do you mean?    
You went to Aethelred.
What did you speak of?    
I spoke of opportunity.    
To do what?    
To declare himself King of Mercia,    
to enrage Alfred, to cause division.    
To help our cause.
To kill his wife?    
Do not sleep tonight.    
You may not wake.    
Do not sleep any night.    
Yes, I may have suggested to Aethelred    
that he should kill his wife,
but why ever not?    
She is Alfred's daughter,
it'd cause more chaos.    
What does it matter?
It matters.    
 Why? She is the enemy.    
Or did Father Beocca travel all this way
to ask you to go and save her?    
After all, it is what you do best.
Rescue princesses.    
Ragnar, I ask you to make the square.    
I've had enough of him.    
Then ignore him.
I will not.    
I will fight him right now and kill him.    
Why? Because the turd
has found the truth?    
Uhtred, we are supposed to be one army,
my friend.    
I predict the Lord Uhtred
is about to desert this army.    
Aethelflaed has called,
and her hound shall go running...    
 He is not worth it.    
 And there
is the proof if need...    
Proof of what?
You are torn between Saxon and Dane!    
Ragnar, your brother seems conflicted.
Is he with us or not?    
Uhtred, what do you say?
How is your answer?    
What do you say?    
I say this army can never hold.    
Ragnar, look around you.
We're enemies, bound only by greed.    
There is no bond, no respect...
No bond, you say?    
Then who am I?    
You are my brother.    
Is that not bond enough?
Or does it not compare to a princess?    
It would appear not.    
And you, why are you here?
What is your message?    
Ragnar. Ragnar!
Your argument is with me alone.    
Uhtred is a free man, Ragnar.
His choices are his own.    
Then choose.    
Do you stand with us,
with each of us, or not?    
You will give your answer, Dane-slayer.
Let us hear you.    
    
    
I will be leaving.    
I will be leaving,
though I will not be returning to Wessex.    
I am needed.    
By a princess.    
You're no more a Dane
than the priest here.    
You're a whore to the crown of Alfred.    
You would do this to me?    
Again?    
I must.
Yes, of course you must.    
You swore an oath.    
You gave your word.    
And that is about reputation and honor.    
What my father gave to you,
I now take back.    
You are no longer Uhtred Ragnarson.    
Ragnar, you cannot do that, please...
You are no longer my brother!    
This was a game to you.    
Never.    
Go... before I kill you.    
He does not leave with Skade.
Ragnar, she belongs to me.    
Yes, Bloodhair. We shall make the square.    
And you can fight for the witch...
to the death.    
Agreed.
Lord, say nothing.    
Agreed.    
We fight.

SEASON: 03
EPISODE: 01
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred.
Born a Saxon nobleman, 
I was robbed of my ancestral lands
and raised as a Dane and as a pagan. 
I am Uhtred of Bebbanburg
and I shall take what is mine.  
But I became
King Alfred's greatest sword warrior, 
defending his kingdom of Wessex
and his vision of one united England, 
supported by my loyal band of cutthroats,
barbarians and a fallen priest. 
I pray that, when battle comes,
I will not fail you.  
 I have found happiness
with my wife, Gisela, 
who has given me two children. 
Alfred has married his own daughter
to the weak Aethelred, 
who sees himself as king of Mercia. 
But taken by the Danes, 
she fell for one warrior, Erik,
and is coveted by Haesten. 
   
 This Haesten
has seemingly allied himself to Alfred. 
He can never be trusted. 
Now that Alfred's health is failing, 
these are dark and dangerous times
for all the peoples of this land. 
Destiny is all. 
   
   
   
 God save your king!   
   
   
   
 Father Beocca.   
If what we believe is true
and heaven awaits us...   
Which it does, Lord, no doubt.   
I fear that even if I were allowed
to pass through the gates,   
it'd still feel like purgatory.   
It will not. It cannot. It is heaven.   
What has changed since I took the crown?   
Danes still raid and slaughter continues   
and will continue
until the day I die and beyond.   
What has been my purpose?   
Your purpose, Lord,
is that you are God's King.   
Without you there would be no church,   
no Wessex, no laws,   
no burhs, no havens of safety...   
no idea of an England.   
What you have done   
is laid the foundations
for a great and godly country.   
Nothing has changed. No task is complete.   
And after I am gone, what then?   
What you have begun will continue.   
It must.   
Yes.   
Thank you, Beocca.   
It must.   
 Guards!   
Turn away now!   
No man is to show me his face!   
No man is to see me before Bloodhair!   
   
You'll go and remind the camp   
that Earl Sigurd
must be the first to see me.   
Yes, lady.   
   
Once he has my message,
they'll be free to gaze.   
My lady, I swear, I did not look at you.   
I must take your eyes.   
Lady, no, be merciful.   
And your tongue.   
Bitch! I'll kill you!   
   
No. No.   
   
 Turn away!   
Only the women may look at me   
until I have told my Lord
what I have seen.   
Sigurd, my love, drink me
and make my vision real.   
Let me give you
all the strength you'll need.   
I see the death of a king.   
   
Which king?   
I see the death...   
of Alfred.   
   
   
It has been seen.   
It has been seen!   
The death of Alfred   
and the glory of Odin's warriors
has been seen!   
Our path will not be simple.   
The gods will demand
that we earn our reward.   
But I make you this promise...   
   
   
From the smallest pig,   
to the golden crown upon Alfred's head,   
Wessex and everything it holds   
shall belong to the
warriors of Bloodhair!   
   
   
 Yes!   
   
 No.    
Again!    
    
Uhtred, what is your opinion
of Edward's sword skill?    
    
My opinion, Lord,
is that Steapa is wasting his time.    
Would you care to explain?    
I will, Lady.    
Steapa, stop.    
Stop this nonsense.    
You should not be using swords.
Skills are taught with a staff.    
Thank you.
I prefer the weight of a sword.    
It is a sign of the atheling's bravery.    
Let us watch, my dear.    
What have you learned?    
He learns by the day.    
Mother, please.    
Show me.    
    
Lord, that grubby Dane, Haesten, is here.    
Uhtred, you must test the boy.    
    
Put the child on his arse.    
It is not your place to speak.    
    
Oh, bad luck, Edward.    
Uhtred, we have a visitor.
An old friend of yours.    
 Sacrifices were made
so you would live, boy.    
From now on you practice only
with a staff. You learn from being hit.    
There is warrior inside you.
We will find him.    
 Thank you, Uhtred.    
 You do
as the Lord Uhtred says, Prince Edward.    
He has your safety and welfare in mind.    
Bishop Erkenwald. Thank you.    
I trust your wife is well?
She is.    
 Pretty girl.
Her name escapes me.    
She's called Gisela, Lord, a pagan.    
She is once again with child.    
A boy.    
Your child shall be a boy.    
Brother Godwin has a gift.    
God-given.    
If you will excuse me, Lord.    
Of course.    
Edward, you are late for your lessons.    
Come.    
    
I hear there are ealdormen
who wish you dead.    
You made a whore
of a young girl and left her pupped.    
She is no whore.    
Bad Edward.    
She is no whore.    
Say it again, I dare you.    
Bad Edward.    
His name is Sigurd.    
His men call him Bloodhair.    
 I don't wish to know why.
Something depraved, I'm sure.    
 I have a man watching
Bloodhair's camp,    
but I'm curious...    
He didn't ask you to join, Haesten?    
He has.    
I declined.    
Like you, I have given my word.    
Unlike you,
I've accepted the King's missionary.    
 Your word means nothing.    
 Does the peace
among us not hold?    
Do my wife and children
not wish to become Christian?    
 They do?    
 They do, Lady.
I've asked the priest to arrange it.    
That is good news.    
It is certainly news.    
It should be an occasion, Lord.    
 I will consider it    
as soon as we are done
with Earl Sigurd, Bloodhair.    
Will he attack or raid?    
 He will raid
to assess your strength and readiness.    
It is you who must attack.    
Destroy his army
and send a message to all Northmen.    
    
    
My Lord has eaten something
that does not agree?    
Too much wine, Lord?    
    
Uhtred, you are right.    
Sigurd landing his ships on Wessex soil
is unacceptable.    
We will attack before the winter bites.
Soonest, Lord.    
Then we march.    
Beocca, send word to Aethelred of Mercia.    
This is a threat to both our lands.    
Our allies must join
with the Wessex guard.    
Yes, Lord.
I will draft the letter at once.    
Inform him, we shall join him
at the Burh of Aescengum.    
I will now, um...    
take some air.    
How is the Lady Aethelflaed these days
and the child?    
Who does the girl resemble...    
One more word against her,    
I'll shove that food so far down
that you'll be sh1tting it out.    
I have seen him do it. It's a miracle.    
I am saying nothing
her husband Aethelred is not saying.    
And I would say
you are in Aethelflaed's debt.    
You have men and ships
not because you earned them,    
but solely because
she did kill your lord, Sigefrid.    
I remember what the bitch did.    
I will never forget.    
That is enough.    
Tell her, I pray
our paths will meet once again.    
 Haesten.    
No more.    
Bloodhair has a woman
you would like, Uhtred.    
Skade.    
Her beauty blinds you like the sun,    
yet she has all the
darkness of the night.    
She's a seer.    
She's of the devil, Father.    
I'd say it was a pleasure
to see you, Uhtred...    
but it never is.    
Likewise.    
May God forgive me,    
but I'd like to remove that
man's head with a blunt ax.    
The King's health, Beocca, it worsens.    
From time to time, yes.    
That is why the time you spend    
with the aetheling, Edward,
is so important.    
Alfred's work must continue,
and you can ensure that it does.    
Tell the King I'll meet him
on the road to Aescengum or at the burh.    
Where are you going?
To my wife.    
Then on to see Bloodhair for myself.    
You should seek the King's permission.    
For once.    
    
A good morning, Lord?    
 Ready yourselves and the horses.
We leave before nightfall.    
For where?
For battle.    
And not before time.    
I'm a warrior.    
 I'll take this.    
What's this, Gisela?    
We have servants to prepare food.
You should be resting.    
I have said this to her.    
How can I rest
with this wild boy inside of me?    
A priest has just told me the same,
that you are carrying a boy.    
Of course it's a boy.
He will not keep still.    
Thankfully, he will be the last.    
You can't prevent that.    
I know how to prevent it.    
He will be the last.    
You are marching?    
Yes, I will join Finan
and then we are marching.    
Thyra will be here.    
And I have sent word home,
to Coccham, to Hild.    
She'll be with you for the birth
should I not return in time.    
But I promise, I will return.    
Mmm-hmm.    
And when you do,
you will be sleeping alone.    
You would do that to me?    
Oh, yes, I will do that to you...    
for a time.    
We move!    
    
Good evening to you.    
Though I'm pointing a sword
at your heart...    
I am a friend.    
Habit.    
With me.    
Then you can tell me
all about your village.    
    
    
 Holy Father,
spare me from this ordeal.    
Stop my heart from beating
and take me now.    
I beg of all the saints in heaven
to strike me down.    
Take my soul and hide. Spare me, Lord.    
It is not death I fear,
it is the path. Lord, I beg you.    
Stop my heart from beating
and take me now.    
Please, please.    
Where is the silver?    
There is none.    
Where is the silver?    
I'm begging you to believe me.
I do not lie.    
If you wish to be cooked alive,
then I will cook you alive.    
 There is no silver! I swear!    
Lady...    
    
 The silver!    
    
You will answer her.    
 I have answered her, Lord.
There is no wealth here!    
    
Put him into the fire.    
No, please! Please, I beg you!    
The silver!    
Can any of you holy men answer for him?    
God in heaven, help me!    
    
 Help me!    
You have no right, Lord.
He was mine to question and to kill.    
You have no right!    
This is a church,
and a church holds silver.    
You.    
What's your name?    
I am called Brother Hubert, Lord.    
My Lord, I swear, we are a poor church.
We have food and ale,    
but we have no more.    
Brother Hubert...    
if you speak the truth,
you'll take your own life.    
You will do it now and save your friends.    
But, Lord, my soul will be damned.    
Take your life like a warrior!
And we'll ask for only food and ale.    
Lord, I swear, there is no silver.    
They're yours to do with as you please.    
    
    
Are you certain
you will not use the carriage?    
I'm certain. We ride to Aescengum.    
Steapa.    
    
    
 Lady, Bloodhair is heading on
to the next village in search of silver.    
Did you hear me? He's ready to leave.
Then let him!    
We will remain here until I've finished
my work with the priests.    
Tell him we will follow.
But he is to leave my guard.    
Yes.    
    
Good morning, Hubert.    
I believe you now.    
There is no silver.    
So, what else can you give me?    
    
 We are ready to march.    
Then you should march.    
But with half of the guard, no more.    
You will follow?    
Yes, we are allies with Wessex.    
There is talk of Danes
raiding on our northern border.    
There are forever Danes there.    
I shall remain here
for the good of Mercia.    
We cannot neglect our own lands.    
Lord, it makes sense
to remain close to Wessex.    
Alfred will not live forever
and the aetheling, Edward, is a boy.    
He seems to be doing his very best
at living forever.    
He's constantly ill, but he will not die.    
If you see him, tell him
I am busy with Vikings.    
I'll inform my father that you'll join us
as soon as you are able, Lord.    
Thank you, lady.    
You are riding to battle?
Is that not forbidden?    
I wish to see the King.    
He is a king. He is not the King.    
There are kings and kingdoms all over.    
Aldhelm, are we ready?    
Lord, you are certain you will not ride?
Go!    
In God's name, go. Leave me in peace.    
Yes, Lord.    
Good luck at the northern border.
Return safely.    
You should be leading your men.    
I do not wish to hear the whining voice    
of the so-called Lady of Mercia.    
Which is why I prefer you
to spend time at your own estate.    
Then I shall leave you in your peace.    
How is your daughter?    
Our daughter is well,    
though I pray she does not inherit
her father's temperament.    
Nor the morals of her mother.    
Whore!    
You have diminished me.    
    
We march into Wessex...    
to the aid of Wessex,    
but be in no doubt, what we fight for    
is the freedom and the glory of Mercia.    
And once again,
we will show the King Alfred    
how a warrior should be.    
    
We will show the bastard heathen
how a warrior should be!    
    
    
She's in there, inside the church.
Am I still needed?    
Go find your family.    
    
    
Who are you? What do you want?    
I would like you all to surrender.    
Or I will smite you.    
What did he say?    
Smite?    
What is "smite"?    
It's a word, isn't it?    
A word from the Holy Book.    
It means slay or kill.    
I will kill you.    
    
Smite.    
You will smite all of us?
Yeah, most.    
Some might run away, hopefully.    
I've got... I've got a sword.    
A very sharp sword.    
But I prefer your surrender.    
 kill him.
Now!    
    
    
Haesten says she is of the devil.    
Then it might be an idea
to bar the door and burn the place down.    
Why not?
To Bloodhair, she will be priceless.    
 You are Skade?    
You! You will do nothing
except go to your lord.    
You will tell him that
Uhtred of Bebbanburg has his witch.    
I knew it was you.    
There will be a ransom.    
No. You will go to my lord    
and you will tell him
that from this moment forth,    
Uhtred of Bebbanburg is cursed.    
The witch holds his heart in her hands    
and she will squeeze it...    
and break it.    
Go.    
It is you who are my
prisoner now, Uhtred.    
Seize her.    
I said seize her, Sihtric.
Now, bind her hands.    
I have aligned myself
with the three spinners of fate    
and seized your life.    
You belong to me.
And her mouth.    
Your path is the path I choose for you,
Uhtred Ragnarson.    
And your spirit is mine to torment.    
Cover her eyes.    
We'll take her to Aescengum.    
I think she may have got herself
inside his head.    
He should kill her and be done with it.    
That will not kill the curse.    
There is no curse.    
And if I say there is no Christian God,
does that make it so?    
There is no curse, Sihtric.    
I have seen women throw a curse
and the next day a man is dead.    
Right, that is enough talking.    
To speak of it makes it stronger.    
 Uhtred, we're
discussing strategy    
and I have decided we shall remain here,    
within the burh, and wait.    
 For what?    
 Bloodhair to attack.
What makes you believe he will attack?    
Is that not what Danes do, Uhtred?
They cannot help themselves.    
Why should he not? I am here.    
You are here, and so too is your guard.    
Why throw men against the walls of a burh    
when Winchester's riches are unprotected?    
Would he do that?    
He doesn't have a large army
to hold Winchester.    
What if Haesten joined him?
You're saying we should've stayed home?    
If you believe
the burh's advantage dismissed,    
you must have an alternative.    
 I don't know you.
I am Sigebriht, son of Sigelf.    
It is my villages that the heathen burn.
My father built these walls.    
He built them well, Sigebriht,
which is why Bloodhair will not attack.    
He will not want to lose men.
Not even to kill a king?    
He will wait    
for us to starve or he will pass, Lord.
He will not attack.    
But we must. That is still my advice.    
If Winchester is vulnerable, Lord...    
This woman that you have taken,
why is she here?    
She has value.    
And Sigurd will want her back.
I refuse to call him Bloodhair.    
He will.
 She is what to him?    
A wife?    
A lover?    
She's a... a seer...    
sorceress.    
 Hmm.    
The simple mind of a Dane
believes in signs, Edward.    
If a bird flew from their camp to ours,
they would see it as a sign and follow.    
They would march into battle    
all because a seer
caught sight of a bird.    
Yes, Lord, it can happen that way.    
Then it follows that without his seer,
there can be no signs.    
Sigurd is blind. There can be no battle.
You are both right and wrong.    
We wait, Uhtred.    
Now...    
I wish to look at her.    
Skade.    
Father, you do not need
to trouble yourself.    
No, Lord?    
 Unlock the door.    
 What are they doing?    
Alfred said he'd like to hump the witch.    
No word of a lie.    
    
    
Uhtred, you will leave us.    
Is that wise, Lord?    
She is secured by chains
and I will not venture too close.    
You will leave.    
    
You left him alone?    
It's his wish.    
You believe that Bloodhair
will go directly to Winchester?    
Our families are there unprotected.    
That is why we cannot wait
for an attack that will not come.    
Uhtred, you must...    
make him see the danger...    
for those we love.    
You reek of death, Lord.    
I do. Sadly, I do.    
Why sadly?    
You have a rich life and reputation.    
There is more to be done.
I must see that it is done.    
Ask your question.    
How long...    
before I am taken? Do you know?    
Is that something that you can see?    
    
You will not see another summer.    
But your name will live on.    
You will be remembered    
as the first, the last
and only king of all Saxons.    
I do enjoy the summertime.    
 Sigurd, my Lord,
Bloodhair, my lover,    
hear me, free me, avenge me.    
Come for me, die for me,
want me, desire me.    
Sigurd, free me!    
Bloodhair, come to me!    
Die for me, avenge me!    
Free me!    
There's a king in this camp!    
Come to me! Desire me!    
If she insists upon calling,
we should make use of her.    
 Free me!    
Bloodhair!    
Come for me, avenge me,
free me, I demand it!    
Bloodhair!    
When can we bind her mouth?
 Die for me, desire me!    
Let her sing.
 There is a king in this town!    
That is not singing.    
 Bloodhair!    
 Lord Uhtred.
 Come for me!    
Are you allowing that woman
to wail all night?    
 Free me!
For a little while longer, yes.    
 Bloodhair!    
There's a king for you to kill!    
 Shut her up!
 Come for me, avenge me, free me!    
I demand it!    
Die for me! Desire me!    
 Here is a bit
of loose talk for you.    
 Bloodhair!    
Sigebriht there, son of whoever,    
would like to rip the innards
from young Edward's belly.    
Would you like to know why?
 Bloodhair!    
Um...    
No.
I'll tell you.    
Edward, the non-bastard son of Alfred,    
has whelped twins on the girl
whom Sigebriht did love.    
And does Sigebriht still love this girl?    
 Die for me, desire me! Bloodhair!    
Can someone not just cut her throat?    
Why are you telling me this?
It's of no concern to me.    
They will make it your concern, Uhtred.    
They will find a way
and Edward shall become your charge.    
You're a kingmaker, my friend.    
And Alfred knows it.    
 I am undecided.    
I could take the place of your woman,
Uhtred Ragnarson.    
Together we could rule
from north to south.    
Hear it.    
Hear it.    
You men there,
take her down and return her to the cell.    
Let her rest.    
 Good night, Lord.    
Why have you not killed me?    
What is it you want?    
I'm worth more than just silver.    
Put the food into your mouth and chew.    
If it is me that you want...    
then have me.    
I will not object.    
I have no need of a whore.    
You will soon have need of a woman.    
You have not killed me, Lord,
because that will leave you cursed still.    
Until the end and beyond,    
our paths are entwined    
and our fate is shared.    
    
He is here.    
    
    
Lord, it is Bloodhair! He has hostages!    
Every man to the walls!
Every sword and spear must be ready!    
    
    
Osferth, prepare to open the gates.
Finan, with me.    
 What is it?
 Who is it?    
Bloodhair, Lord, with hostages.
He wishes to negotiate?    
 Possibly.    
    
 Uhtred Ragnarson.    
What depravity is this?    
 Alfred of Wessex,
you have my woman.    
Return her now or your people will die.    
Lord, I know each of those wretches.    
Does he wish to negotiate or not?    
If it is your woman that you want,
then let us negotiate!    
We don't wish to see
the death of another innocent!    
I've said all I will say.
 I beg you, not the young.    
Spare the young!    
    
 I beg you, Lord,
not the young, please.    
Spare the young, Lord.
They can serve you. Please, Lord.    
    
Osferth, the gates. Steapa, be ready.    
They are killing women, Lord.
The gates!    
Earl Sigurd!    
kill one more hostage    
and I shall let every man here
see her nakedness    
and then I shall spill her guts.
Just one more!    
Do it, Lord.
I'll see you in the next life.    
kill them all! attack!    
    
 kill them! attack!
She is an angry woman.    
 What's your answer?    
I have a mind to kill her. She tires me.    
He cannot do it. He's cursed.    
kill them all!    
You will not harm her again!    
    
The price has risen.    
You will spare the hostages,    
free them
and send them across to the burh.    
What I'll do is feed you your own cock.
Release her.    
You have until sunset
to free the hostages.    
Or each man in this fortress
will take his turn.    
Until sunset!    
I believe negotiations are over, Lord.    
You will not see Valhalla,
Uhtred Ragnarson, I swear it!    
 Bloodhair!
Uhtred Ragnarson!    
 kill them!
 Uhtred Ragnarson!    
Do not harm one hair from her head.
She's mine!    
Lord, we need to change our plan.    
We cannot wait for him to attack
because he will not.    
Her value is even greater
than I first thought.    
He will wait for as long as it takes.    
Aethelred and the Mercians will be close.    
They will be seen.    
We must stop them on the road.    
I can send Finan to do just that,
and then we must join them.    
We must choose the place of battle,    
but we must act quickly,
while his blood burns.    
Join Aethelred where?    
I am thinking Fearnham. There's a hill.    
I know it. It gives us an advantage.    
How do we join Aethelred here,    
and how do we ensure
Earl Sigurd will follow?    
Finan will find the Mercians
and we will ensure Bloodhair follows.    
You and I, Lord, will draw him.    
And if Aethelred cannot be found?    
 We fight alone.    
But we must act quickly.
It must be today.    
I'm ready, Lords.    
It won't take me long
to find the Mercians.    
To Fearnham. Go.    
    
 Open the gates!    
Psst.    
The gates.    
We go and we do not stop.    
They cannot overtake us!
They must not overtake us!    
For the freedom of Wessex!    
    
They're escaping.    
Lord! Lord, they are running!    
Lord, the Saxon army
is fleeing the fortress.    
Who did you see?
I saw them all.    
I saw the Lady Skade.
I saw Uhtred Ragnarson.    
The whole army.    
Every man and every sword with me.
It's time!    
Horses!    
 Close the gates!    
    
    
 Lord!    
They're giving chase.    
They're giving chase.    
 We wait...    
long enough for them not to see
they are being followed.    
And we pray.    
    
 Lord, the cart is stuck.    
Release the horse from its harness
and ride.    
Sihtric, your ax.    
They've been after silver,
so let's give them some.    
Keep going! Ride!    
 We must not be seen! 
We track them.    
And then we kill the bastards!    
    
 May be a trap.    
 Is this the place?    
Is this Fearnham?
It is.    
Maybe Finan didn't make the journey.    
Do we wait for the Danes to catch us?    
It's silver, Lord.    
They must have been too afraid
to fix the cart.    
Wrap it in cloth. Keep it safe.
Let's move on.    
I want every Saxon dead by nightfall.    
 Move on!    
Your man is here. I know it.    
    
 It is Finan.    
And the Mercians.    
We are an army!    
Glory shall be ours!
    
    
    
    
Shield wall!    
 Ready!    
They have the hill.
We have the numbers and will of the gods!    
Odin's warriors!    
    
 We stand our ground!
They will come onto us,    
and we will take their heads
from their shoulders!    
No Saxon leaves this field alive!    
    
Hold firm!    
We do not break! We stand our ground!    
For Mercia!    
    
Fight for your women and your children!    
    
Hold the line!    
Get me up, man!
 Close the gap!    
Hold!    
    
Who sounds the horn?    
Who sounds the horn?    
 It is Alfred.    
It is Alfred and the men of Wessex!    
Steapa!
Shield wall!    
Hold the line!    
 Advance!    
    
 Advance!    
 We're trapped!    
    
 Lord, do we fight?    
Bloodhair, you do not yield.    
Do not yield.    
 Give them no ground!    
Give them nothing but your sword!    
 They are running scared!    
They are beaten!    
    
    
Uhtred...    
she's gone.    
She's given you a son.    
But she's gone.    
    
I must go to her.
Uhtred, no!    
No, I must go to her!
Uhtred, she's gone!    
She's in the ground.    
It was days ago.    
She's gone.

SEASON: 03
EPISODE: 02
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred.
Like my childhood friend Brida,  I was born Saxon but raised as a Dane.
But while she embraced her Viking life,  I chose another path.
My sword is yours.
Defending King Alfred's Kingdom, supporting his vision of England,  I earned reputation as a killer of Danes,  and with my loyal followers, I have slain many a warrior.
Alfred is dying,  and all are vying for power and position.
Alfred will not live forever.
He is constantly ill, but he won't die.
Our ancestors were kings,  yet we're barely acknowledged as Ealdormen.
We deserve more.
I stole the seer Skade from her Lord Sigurd.
With Sigurd defeated in battle, she is tied to me now.
You do not yield.
My beloved Gisela did die in childbirth,  leaving me with an infant I despise.
She has given you a son.
From this moment forth,  Uhtred of Bebbanburg is cursed.
She is the power behind my misfortune.
Destiny is all!
Are you done, Lord?
Not quite.
Soon.
Uhtred.
One moment, please.
Lord, I pray,  forgive the breaking of this peaceful ground.
It is an act of love.
Amen.
Amen.
Lord.
Lord.
It's beautiful.
She is drifting away from the earth  and upward to the heavens.
We've done a good thing here.
God knows it.
The gods know it.
Brother Godwin.
Good morning.
Lord.
Good morning.
I'd like to speak with you... for a moment.
The girl there...
What of her?
She could well be fond of you.
Fond?
As in fondle.
Fondling.
And often.
You have my attention, Lord.
Uhtred.
He is not the man to guide Prince Edward.
He is wild, ungodly.
He is half Dane.
Oh, at least.
The Bishop Erkenwald needs to see this.
Alfred needs to be reminded of this.
She could be fond of you this very evening.
Holy ground has been disturbed, Brother Godwin.
Uhtred!
Uhtred!
You are needed at the palace by the King.
For what reason?
We are about to return to Coccham.
It would be better if you heard it from him yourself.
You alone.
Lord.
Been telling Father Beocca  that you should be seizing Bloodhair's ships.
Earl Sigurd is finished with, defeated.
Take away his ships and we take away the means  by which he will leave.
Then take half the ships, we've killed half his men.
Haesten is about to send Bloodhair on his way.
We've been assured.
He will soon be gone.
To the matter in hand.
Uhtred,  I do not forget what you have done these past days.
Past years, Lord.
I am acutely aware of what you have lost,  of your suffering.
Lord.
Gisela was a most hospitable woman.
How is the child?
She has given him her strength.
And life.
Yes.
She was a good woman.
Thank you, Lord.
There has been a desecration.
You were seen.
The graveyard, Uhtred,  it is blessed holy ground.
You do not have the right nor authority to break this ground.
You were seen willfully disturbing the peace of the dead.
I disturbed no one but my wife.
If I have done wrong, I apologize It is very wrong.
I put the earth back.
It was a desecration.
Uhtred, I admit I am at a loss with what to do.
Is an apology enough?
If it is heartfelt, Lord.
God is merciful.
He is, and Uhtred's actions, understandable.
But not forgivable.
I swear, I meant no insult.
If I may speak, Lord?
The woman Gisela was a pagan,  and did not belong in holy ground.
By removing her,  Lord Uhtred was undoing what shouldn't have been done.
Her presence would have poisoned the soil.
I believe the dead are well rid of her.
Rid of her?
Brother Godwin speaks in your favor, Uhtred.
I speak the truth.
Gisela was a pagan and a whore,  still married to Aelfric of Bebbanburg.
You will say no more.
You will say no...
She was a whore.
Her children, bastards.
Enough, Godwin.
I'd have the poor wretches taken and baptized...
Lord, I won't listen to this nonsense.
The souls in heaven are rejoicing...
Godwin!
...that the heathen Gisela  has been taken from the earth and burnt!
Brother Godwin!
She was no better  than the witch Skade whom he has brought to...
No more!
He has struck him!
I am not blind.
Now it is your turn to apologize, priest!
Insulting women!
Hiding behind your affliction and your cross!
Get away from him now.
Uhtred.
He did himself no favor, you all heard him!
Lord,  I fear he is dead.
He cannot be dead.
It was a slap, no more than that.
He is dead.
It was a slap, Lord, you saw it for yourself.
Guards, seize him.
It was a slap.
Seize him.
Seize him now!
I said take hold of him!
Steapa, secure the city walls!
No one is to leave.
No one.
Lord...
I want him here by nightfall!
Uhtred!
Uhtred!
I told you, big man, he's resting.
Uhtred, do not make me fire the house!
That is what I will do!
Steapa, do not make me kill you first,  that is what I will do.
Uhtred, do not make me step on your Irishman!
That's what I will do!
Oh, for goodness' sake, stop behaving like children.
You are goading him.
I was, Hild.
And enjoying it.
So the Abbess may enter, but I may not?
We're afraid of the Abbess.
Sister Hild!
Come to bed.
Lord, there can be no bloodshed.
They are throwing insults out there, but they will soon tire of that.
Come.
There will not be bloodshed.
You should say that to Steapa.
His head is hurting from thinking.
Is there a solution?
I did nothing wrong.
Uhtred,  you killed a monk,  a holy man,  and not for the first time.
And why is she still here?
I am not your concern, witch.
I did not intend to kill the monk,  nor do I regret it.
It was fate.
Fetch Beocca.
Ask him to bring the demands of the King.
I will tell Beocca  that you are ready to talk and to listen.
Be sure that you do.
It would help if you cut her throat.
He cannot.
He dare not.
Tonight, Lord...
you'll break your oath to Alfred.
You'll have...
You will be quiet!
It is a new beginning.
I did not wish for a new beginning.
This is your doing.
All of it.
You speak another word and I will end your life,  no matter the curse nor the consequences.
I thought I would keep you company, Beocca.
I feel more godly just walking beside you.
Aethelwold, you are only here for the game.
I am, but what a game.
Open up.
Uhtred.
The King and Edward have conferred  and they have decided there will be no trial.
No punishment,  saving a small wergild to be paid to the church.
A wergild?
100 pieces of silver.
That's all?
Of course not.
One hundred pieces of silver and your oath.
He has my oath.
The King wishes that you swear an oath to the aetheling, to Edward.
Edward is not the aetheling.
The crown cannot be assumed.
Then Alfred is asking for my life.
Just your loyalty to Edward.
He's a boy!
Swear an oath to a boy, it is the rest of your life.
Father, the King asks too much.
What you must now do, Uhtred,  is consider what will happen if you do not swear the oath to Edward.
People will die.
It won't just be the men here who will die!
It'll be the men you fought beside...
It will be Alfred's doing.
...days ago.
He couldn't care less for men in his service.
The King cares deeply!
You, Beocca, you served him all your life, and for what?
His witan whisper about your choice of wife?
Without Alfred, I would be dead!
Without Alfred, there would be no Wessex, there would be no Mercia, no Christendom.
There would be Danes!
And that is all.
The green fields would be red with blood and I'd be dead.
Look, for all your whines and moans,  Uhtred of Bebbanburg, you've had a good life here in Wessex,  and don't you dare say otherwise.
Alfred gave you shelter.
I have earned it.
You have land and wealth,  food and drink.
I've earned it.
Make your choice, boy!
Accept your punishment or allow your friends to kill each other,  all to spare you the hardship of life as a lord!
Did I not say it would be more than a wergild?
Aethelwold, I swear, when the killing starts,  you shall be my first.
There will be no killing.
Steapa.
Lord.
I will not fight you nor any of these men here.
I'll go with you to the King, friend.
I am pleased to hear you say that, Lord.
The King is merciful.
He knows your worth.
We shall see.
You know what to do.
You have something to say, I'm told.
Lord.
Look around you.
I ask that you remember my service to you at Ethandun,  and more, much more.
Good service past is no excuse for breaking the law of the land.
I will pay the wergild,  but though Edward's a fine young man,  I cannot swear an oath I will not keep.
You know this.
An oath to protect Edward is an oath for the rest of my life.
Your word has meaning, I will give you that,  which is the very reason I would like you beside my son  when I am gone and he is King.
You have Steapa.
Steapa at his left hand and you at his right.
There is no negotiation to be had, Uhtred.
None.
Have I not given enough, Lord?
I beg of you.
Self pity does not suit you.
I am allowing you to live.
You will do as I ask.
No, Lord.
I will not.
Uhtred!
Father!
Steapa, put down your sword!
Do nothing more!
Edward, no!
Edward, stand still!
Uhtred, this is madness.
Not one man is to take a single step closer!
Not one step!
Steapa, kill the bastard.
Do it now!
No!
Steapa!
No man is to make a single move!
No man is to put the King's life in danger!
Do you understand?
This means death for you, it can be nothing else.
Away from the door!
Uhtred, please.
Every man away from the door!
Uhtred.
Please, I beg of you one last time.
Beocca,  you'll close and bar the door.
You will ensure no one follows.
Not until Alfred himself knocks.
Lord, on my oath, he will not harm you.
But if he does harm you,  I swear, I will kill him myself.
Beocca, the door!
Now!
I gave you glory!
I gave you the freedom to worship your God,  and still you treat me no better than a hound!
I should kill you.
Then do it,  like the heathen you are.
Think I am afraid?
I can smell the shit on your legs.
Heaven awaits me,  but you shall burn in hell for all eternity!
Valhalla is a lie and your gods are a lie!
I seem to have broken my oath, Lord.
With luck, the whole of Wessex will now burn.
Father Beocca!
Yes, Lord!
Find him and kill him.
He's here!
Close the gates!
I wish no harm.
Stay there!
Stand clear.
Don't move.
After him!
Uhtred!
Every man with me!
Spear!
Uhtred, don't do it!
Uhtred!
You two, come with me!
The rest of you, go round.
So, they decided to let you go?
We should ride, hard.
Lord, you are cut.
Barely.
We ride to where, Lord?
To Ragnar and to the Danes.
Then we should go meet your men.
Hurry!
Hyah, hyah!
Go, all of you.
I wish to be alone.
All of you, go!
Lord.
You throw an ax well.
Can you use that sword?
It's not a sword.
It's just the handle.
It did break.
In battle?
I fell, Lord.
At least you're honest.
I'm looking for men, guards.
There are guards at the palace.
No, I am looking to form my own guard.
If you had a sword, could you use it?
I could, yes.
I'm called Offa.
Offa.
I will employ you and two others.
You know men who would make good guards?
I do.
Good men, friends of mine.
Find them.
We travel tonight.
You will be paid in silver.
Uhtred has thrown everything away.
Everything.
Did he have a choice?
No, he did not.
The King asked for too much.
Alfred offered him forgiveness.
What Alfred did was ignore Uhtred's pain.
This isn't the end of the matter.
It is only the beginning.
If Edward is being made ready to be King,  then Uhtred knows that Alfred's death is near.
That is what he will tell the Danes.
Lord.
She wishes to speak to you.
I wish to ride alongside you.
Your place is at the back of the line.
I wish to ride alongside you as your woman.
You have what you have always craved, your freedom.
Embrace it and embrace me.
Did I not say you would be in need of a woman?
Do not dare to think that you can replace my wife!
I saw what would occur to your wife.
I was not the cause.
I know you would like to bed me.
You are Bloodhair's woman, are you not?
Unless you decide to claim me.
Then I will have a decision to make.
Bloodhair's not the warrior that you are.
He is not the king that you can be.
Lord,  we can be enemies  or lovers.
We can suffer or we can rule.
Back of the line.
Then you shall remain cursed!
It's your choice.
Why is she not food for the rats by now?
Because she has a gift.
Because she has taken hold of my path.
If we kill her, the curse will live on.
It is the curse that must be killed.
She is the worm and Uhtred is the apple.
I am Aethelwold of Wessex.
We are here to drink and to see Lord Aethelred.
Open the gate!
In that order.
What is it about Mercian ale?
It is the waters.
Divine.
I haven't seen Lady Aethelflaed.
My wife prefers her own company.
She often sits at her own estate.
Your fair daughter.
She's how old now?
What is it you want?
Say it.
What I want  is your disloyalty  towards Alfred.
You're probably aware that his health is failing.
His health has been failing and then recovering for years.
But he is now without his best warrior and kingmaker...
Uhtred.
Uhtred is dead?
Uhtred is, by now, on his way to Dunholm and then to Bebbanburg, perhaps.
Where he is not, is Wessex.
Uhtred is no longer Alfred's sword.
Uhtred is gone.
Uhtred is a Dane.
My own ambitions are clear, I have never hid them.
The crown of Wessex is rightfully mine.
But I do not wish to control Mercia.
I have no interest in Mercia.
Yes, yes.
I believe Mercia should have its own King.
You, Aethelred.
What you must understand is our entire world is about to change.
The opportunity to occupy the throne of our respective kingdoms is near.
It is now.
And you are suggesting what, exactly?
I am proposing that we ally ourselves to one another.
A betrothal of sorts.
An alliance.
Lord Aethelred has estate,  a hearth guard and a fyrd to call upon.
You appear to have three men and a scab-ridden pack-horse.
I won't betray any confidence, but believe me,  I shall have an army.
As for Lord Aethelred's guard and fyrd, many say they belong to his wife.
She is the one with a battle reputation.
My men are my own  and no one else's, I can assure you.
I am repeating gossip, no more than...
My men are my own.
Agreed.
Though you must worry,  that despite her bravery, Aethelflaed may come to some harm,  alone on her own estate?
Heavens forbid, but...
should something final befall his daughter,  I imagine that would weaken the pretend King further.
I'd guess you would imagine this weakening quite often,  Lord Aethelwold.
Nightly.
Should we not stop and rest?
I am tired of the sight of my horse's head,  his ears in particular.
We need shelter and fire, boy.
There's no shelter here.
We keep going.
For a short time at least.
Lord!
Lord!
Are you hurt, Lord?
Is it your wound?
No.
She has me.
Jesus, he looks the color of a Scotsman's arse.
Anything broken?
She is squeezing the life from me.
Either that or the cold has got to your bones.
Finan,  you will find a cart  and you will haul me to Dunholm, to Brida.
She will know what to do.
Get him up.
We're being followed.
No, we are being watched, Offa.
Just ahead, there is a camp full of Danes led by a man they call Bloodhair.
Hold up the branch.
Tilberht.
Higher!
Above your head.
What does the branch mean?
That we are peaceful, that we wish to talk.
And if they are Bloodhair's men, which they will be,  with luck,  he'll want to hear what I have to say.
And if they are not?
You will protect me with your lives.
And the branch.
My God, there are hundreds of the bastards.
Every one of them ugly.
Hold the branch high.
Higher!
It's heavy, Lord.
Higher, Tilberht!
Lord Bloodhair,  Haesten.
What a pleasure to see you as a pair.
You know this turd, Haesten?
I do.
Welcome, Lord Aethelwold.
You bring word from Alfred?
I bring word of Alfred.
And I bring word of Uhtred Ragnarson and of the Lady Skade.
She was once your woman, I seem to remember.
Skade lives?
She does.
And lives well, with Lord Uhtred snug between her thighs.
But neither are in Wessex.
Where is Uhtred then?
Banished.
An enemy of Alfred.
Heading to Ragnar Ragnarson, his brother, I would guess.
This turd has knowledge,  and not just of what I've eaten.
I have a proposal.
There already seems to be an alliance between you.
What I suggest is that we grow that alliance  and create the greatest Dane army ever seen.
I propose that we join together.
Us three here, we join with Ragnar  and with Uhtred.
But I want to kill Uhtred.
And then what, kill Ragnar?
Or you, perhaps.
We have your story.
What else do you offer?
I offer unrest in Wessex.
By speaking to certain ealdormen,  I could halve the size of Alfred's army in a moment.
I can be the bridge between Saxon and Dane.
Are you sure Uhtred is in the north?
Yes.
Just as I am sure that Danes cannot fight Danes,  Danes cannot kill allies.
We cannot ignore the gift that is presenting itself.
A Wessex without Uhtred to protect it,  a weakened and frail Alfred.
Now is the time for all Danes to gather.
No divisions.
I say that we take that idea north,  to Ragnar and to Uhtred.
I demand  that the sword-Danes unite  and crush the Anglo-Saxons...
It's not your place to make demands.
Enough that you have been heard.
Excellent.
A few days more, Lord.
It is your cart that is slowing us down.
Remember me, arseling?
You'll get out of your bed and make ready.
For what?
To fight me.
Leofric...
I do not wish to fight you.
Why would I fight you?
You will fight me, you piece of shit!
For I am Wessex!
I am Saxon!
I am for Alfred!
And you, arseling,  are a Dane and a traitor.
Fight me!
Can no man hold his tongue?
The country's rife with news of Uhtred's betrayal  and of my apparent weakness.
The talk will pass, Lord.
The talk will only build.
Gossip and rumor will spread like a summer's fire.
It can only serve to embolden our enemies.
I note that Sigurd's ships remain in Cent.
Yes.
You need to end the gossip, Lord.
A visit, perhaps, not to Sigurd but to several of the burhs.
The King doesn't have the strength to travel.
Then something else.
A celebration.
Something that allows you to show yourself proud, kingly.
For what reason, Father Beocca, to sap him further?
To demonstrate that he has not weakened.
You will both be silent, I am still here.
Yes, Lord.
What would be this occasion be?
I do not know.
A saint's day?
A thanksgiving.
You may wish to involve Edward.
A betrothal.
Edward?
He is old enough.
He's besotted with the mother of his bastard twins.
Oh, it cannot be her.
She is a cloth's width from a peasant.
Then whomever is most suited?
What it would do is put an end  to one line of gossip and begin another.
Indeed.
Father Beocca, would you leave us, please?
Yes, Lord.
I cannot allow Uhtred's betrayal nor this...
illness to defeat me.
England must not be forgotten.
Lord, you shall see its birth,  you will grow strong.
My dear, I will not see another year.
We know it.
We must continue forward.
We must find Edward a suitable match, one that will strengthen his hand.
But a better match than was made for Aethelflaed.
Has that marriage not served a purpose?
Aethelflaed has influence.
She's far stronger than Aethelred the pretty.
What you have begun, Lord,  shall continue.
Our children will build an England,  I swear.
Take it.
No...
You asked for me, Lord?
I did.
I have been thinking about...
Aethelwold's visit,  what he said about my heroic wife.
The chances of her meeting harm in one form or another.
And you have decided what?
I want her dead.
And the child with her.
We've been trailing them for half a day now.
They are mostly Saxon.
Some Danes maybe.
They're not of Eoferwic.
They're warriors.
They're surrounding the cart, there.
Protecting it and the man that lies on it.
It is the riding in clear sight I find interesting.
Mmm.
They have no fear.
You're staring at me.
Why?
I'm looking,  nothing more.
And I'm thinking how fortunate my cousin is  to have a woman to both love and fight.
So why do you allow him to shame you?
Cnut, you know nothing,  so you will say nothing.
Allow them to continue in peace.
All the way to Dunholm?
That's where they're headed.
Has he drunk any ale?
A little.
A little is of little use.
All right.
Do you have the strength to lift a wee cup, Lord?
Hmm?
Even if it is to wet your lips.
Oh, eh.
I'd wager you feel like you're back on the slave ship.
You got past that nightmare.
You can get past this.
Believe me.
It's her, Finan.
Turning my insides outward.
Then kill her.
Or let me do it for you.
No.
Uhtred...
I fear you are dying.
Sihtric says we will arrive at Dunholm tomorrow.
They've been watching us for most of the day.
At least, I hope it's them.
Broth, Lord.
I made it myself.
I did the same at the monastery and the Brothers devoured it.
Please, it'll make your strength.
Now you know how Alfred would feel.
Belly and bones aching.
But every day he got to his feet,  and every day he built Wessex.
With my sword.
Lord?
My arse.
He built Wessex with my sword.
I see my sister's boy is with you now.
Alfred's bastard.
The Monk.
He's no warrior.
Then why is he here?
Gisela.
It's the fever.
It will pass.
He sees someone.
It is the gods,  tormenting him.
Who is Gisela?
My wife.
Another one?
How many is that?
So this Gisela is to blame  for making my nephew a traitor to his country?
She was fond of him.
That is why he is with me.
You look sickly.
What has she done to you, the witch there?
It is a death you will deserve,  for you have made every man here a traitor.
Alfred is their King.
You are dead!
Alfred does not mourn you, so why speak for him?
You are dead!
Lord, Lord.
You must eat and you must drink.
You are not thinking right.
Brida.
She will be at Dunholm.
Finan, look.
I'm here.
Brida?
Jackdaw, any trouble in the night?
She showed me her tits.
They looked very nice.
You say you're a seer,  but you have no runes.
What is this?
Unless you hid them up your arse?
I wish to see my Lord, Uhtred.
And you will bring him to me.
You'll shut your mouth.
Bring him to me or I'll bind your path to that of a river rat!
You will not throw curses.
Not here.
Not now I have this Nithstong to block your powers.
This is Freya's soil now.
The goddess who brought the magic to the gods will protect us.
Don't make me bring the seer to whom this Nithstong belongs.
She is blood-tied to Freya.
Don't make her destroy you.
I swear...
I will kill you, bitch.
Jackdaw...
Hmm?
Keep your hands on your sword and your eyes off her tits.
She's cleverer than you.
I heard that.
Good?
It is good.
We thought you'd gone, Lord.
The same.
I feared I'd die an old man's death under furs.
So, the great Dane-slayer was afraid?
You are who?
He's no one important, Uhtred.
I am Cnut.
You are what?
He is Cnut.
He's my cousin on my mother's side.
I'm a Dane,  Lord Uhtred.
So are you gonna kill me too?
You talk like an infant.
How many have you already despatched to Valhalla?
Is it twelve?
Twenty?
Forty?
You'll shut your mouth now.
Show my brother some respect.
Or I may have to kill one more.
He's back!
He's back.
Get up.
Up on your feet!
Get up.
He is back where he belongs.
Where he has always belonged.
You're a Dane for life now.
Say it.
I am a Dane for life.
No.
Say it.
I am a Dane for life.
Mean it!
I am a Dane for life!
From this day onwards.
From this day onwards.
This means everything to me.
So, do you have an army, Lord Cnut?
I do.
Two hundred men.
Two hundred good men.
Are they all as entertaining as you are?
You are headed where?
Undecided.
Though if Alfred of Wessex is now without his Dane-slayer,  may consider heading south.
Call me Dane-slayer once more, and we'll fight.
Why the anger, Lord?
You deny you killed many of us?
Many Danes, many Northmen?
Only the ones who were trying to kill me.
And I'm only teasing, unfairly.
You must be tired from your journey and your...
illness.
So be sure to rest.
I like him.
Not as much as he likes himself.
Well, he's not wrong.
The prospect of Alfred without Uhtred  will bring fire to the bellies of many Danes.
You included?
Wessex is still the jewel,  and I'm getting too comfortable in my fortress.
My children are in Wessex.
We have many friends in Wessex.
More reasons to visit.
Well, this talk is for another time.
Another time soon.
You've not asked about Thyra.
The boy Osferth told me.
She is Christian,  and she's married.
She is happy.
Uhtred.
I came here to rest, to hunt,  find a woman, maybe.
I did not come here to talk of war against Alfred.
I will be outside drinking ale.
Finish your plate.
Where is she?
Skade?
Caged for now.
She can't reach you.
She's got power, Uhtred.
I have felt it.
Power that you could wield.
It's the way she works, through a man.
A warrior.
My sword is all I need.
I'll not give half of myself over to a seer.
Then you must kill her.
I want to, but how?
Her curse must die with her.
How can I be sure that it does?
I'll ask.
I'll ask a seer more powerful than Skade.
When?
When I am sure of you,  Uhtred of Bebbanburg.
I remember the very first time I took your hand.
On the steps of the great hall in Eoferwic.
A priest was hanging from the wall,  a spear through his chest.
Ragnar tells me you have children.
No.
No, I am not a mother, no.
But Ragnar has children by other women.
I, too, have been cursed.
A child refuses to grow inside me.
My first loss was our child in the wood.
No matter.
Eat as much as you are able.
He will expect you to drink and play games.
Brida.
Hmm?
I'm sorry for you.
Ragnar is my child.
Betray him and I will kill you.
If you are now a Dane,  you must undo the past.
Undo the past?
How?
You must destroy Alfred.

SEASON: 04
EPISODE: 10
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred.
Eardwulf has led the Danes to the greatest prize.
After Tettenhall, Edward believes the Danes no longer hold a threat.
He’s taken his army to Aegelesburg, leaving Winchester undefended.
But Sigtryggr sees the truth of his dark heart.
So, let this man's fate serve as a warning.
Haesten has entrapped me and I have lost those under my protection, even my daughter Stiorra.
And now the king's sons are held captive.
Don’t let them kill us!
Both my heirs!
In Edward’s absence, the Danes strengthen their grasp on Winchester.
Lady Aelswith!
Raise the Fyrd! Raise the Mercian Guard!
The king is rash in his determination to retake the town and will not listen to reason.
Do not do this!
attack! No!
Destiny is all!
Has he gone mad? Leave him. He will not listen.
You must tell him he is being foolish. I have tried. He is not himself.
Be kind, Uhtred. He is at heart a boy who is suffering.
Do you intend to set a fire?
Yes.
We encircle them and draw them out.
Lord King, you should not do this.
It is decided.
The town walls cannot be breached another way.
Our attempts to attack have been futile.
The Danes show no sign of surrender. Perhaps this will force their hand.
The fire will catch and the town will be destroyed.
Lord King, the heart of Wessex will be burnt to ashes.
And so the heathen burns in hell. It is a risk I am resolved to.
What are my choices, Uhtred? Surrender?
Live in history as the King who lost his lands?
Thirty days we have tried and failed.
I... I do this and in time Winchester will rise again, stronger for her suffering.
We should try again to speak with Sigtryggr.
This silence may be a sign he looks for another way.
They do not want to speak.
We send men. They send arrows.
We have asked them to leave and now our patience wears thin!
Yes and they will also be tired of this and may be willing to negotiate.
We are past negotiation.
We win or they do!
Our families are prisoners... Aldhelm, what news?
Lady Aethelflaed sent me here to tell of a great victory.
She has taken Eoferwic and the Danes there have submitted to her rule.
She now travels south with her army.
Let her not be shamed by weakness in her brother.
Let her return to the land of her birth and find it cleansed of the Danes.
Tell them it is decided.
If they do not surrender, Winchester will burn!
...formation!
Halt!
King Edward sends you this message of intent!
Leave the town, or on his command, these flames will...
I knew what he was going to say.
They’re getting desperate.
"755, Cynewulf and the West Saxons deprived Sigebert of his kingdom, because of his unlawful deeds.
Cynewulf often fought great battles in Wealas."
Please, this is so dull. I want to pull out my own eyes.
Spoken like a true heathen.
Shall we play another game? What was the tally again?
I am not keeping count.
Come, read.
I’m too hungry to read.
Is this the last of the bread? I am not keeping count of that either.
Do you still have the grain?
I’m taking the girl. We need to kill a hostage.
And she will get their attention. They threat to use fire.
And in response, we show no mercy.
Then not her. She is worthless.
Not to the Dane-Slayer.
Sigtryggr, I need Uhtred to come out and fight.
This will force his hand.
Is this true? Will your father attack us?
If he does, he’ll destroy you.
Do not succumb to anger, Brida.
Haesten, tell the men to get clay and water.
Dampen the roofs. Protect the walls from fire.
Then I will select a hostage... and we will see what they do.
Hm?
Hurry up, men!
Make haste!
Take it.
Here.
There is some water in a flask here.
But what are you doing?
Don’t worry. I will look after you.
Where is the water? You finished it.
We must pray they offer more.
I am... Please do not say it again.
We know you are hungry.
She is not accustomed to discomfort.
Discomfort! This is nothing compared to what we endured in the marshland.
Just be grateful there are no flies.
I am grateful there is no screaming.
I fear that is because everyone is dead.
We are being kept alive, so they can make a show of our deaths.
Then if they try to take me, I shall throw myself upon their knives.
I can show you a way with a piece of cloth.
I have learned things in my life, which you do not know.
There is a plant that flowers in the courtyard.
The purple blooms, when dissolved in water, are tasteless... and effective... especially in children.
Why would such a plant grow in the courtyard?
It was planted there, should this situation ever arise.
Give me the King's heir.
Come here, boy.
No! That child is the King's first born. He does not care for my son. Take him.
Foolish.
He will assume you are lying and take Aelfweard anyway.
Are you lying?
I do not know.
Which of these two children is more precious to his heart?
I'm the elder brother. I should be chosen.
I will take them both.
Do not give the signal.
You must see how this plan unleashes pointless slaughter.
Each hour we wait is an insult to my father!
Then think of the captive. They are lost to us!
They were lost from the moment the Danes arrived in Wessex.
Do you not see it?
This is my punishment.
I abandoned the children of Mercia and this is God's vengeance for that mistake.
God would not do that, Lord.
We do not have to burn Winchester!
I swear to you I will find another way.
And you always keep to your word, Uhtred.
I will get in, find this Sigtryggr and...
How? We built those walls never to be breached.
So far, they've been more steadfast than any of us.
Father!
Uhtred?
What are you doing here? Where is she?
Where is Stiorra?
She is within, but we have a plan to save her.
King Edward of Wessex!
Make ready King Edward of Wessex!
I have shown myself. Do the same.
Approach the gate and meet me face to face!
I will not take orders from a Dane.
Let us talk, eye to eye!
This is a game and I will not play.
Tell him to surrender, or I will give the signal to burn them all.
Bring the boys.
Lord King!
Lower your weapon!
Come!
Talk to us at the gate!
Come now!
Your sons want to see their father!
Lord, do not approach the gate.
Give me my children, or I will find yours and take their eyes.
I have no children.
Nor a wife.
This is why I'm stronger than you.
Give me my children!
I command it.
I will give you one of your sons if you retreat.
And you may choose which.
Someone speak.
What do I do?
Request the aetheling.
If I choose one child, what happens to the other...?
It is a hard decision, yes.
But I think it is part of a longer strategy to see if you will negotiate.
I... I have looked that man in the eye and he is not one to give ground.
What do you think?
That if we show weakness now... he will make a show of cruelty.
I think say nothing.
Can we pay him?
He doesn’t want silver. If he did, he would have taken it...
He wants to destroy us and destroy our spirit.
I cannot do this. I can...
I can... I cannot... I cannot. I cannot do this.
What would you do?
Much the same as him.
Be broken by it.
Any man would.
It is unnatural to have to choose between your children.
I would want you to pick Stiorra.
I could defend myself if it happened to us.
It will not happen to us.
And it will not happen to the King.
Are you going to do something foolish?
Are you going stop me?
Then you should be pragmatic... and choose the son whose legitimacy is not in question.
I cannot. I cannot be the man to condemn one son over the other.
There must be something else he wants.
He wants me dead.
This much I know from Haesten.
He would not trade you for my sons. You... You are not that valuable to me, Uhtred.
True.
But I do have a value to the Danes.
To kill the man they call the Dane-Slayer would bring great reputation.
He might want that.
And Brida will want revenge for her enslavement in Wealas.
Let me offer myself. It is worth trying.
Then Wessex would once again be in your debt.
And should you not return, I will ensure they speak of your honor through the ages.
Uhtred will not be forgotten.
This is a brave plan.
Which plan is that?
He doesn't have a plan.
This is what he looks like when he's making it up.
You cannot hope to take them on single-handed?
What do you think he's doing, then?
I presume you’re trying to get us some time.
If you can delay the Danes until Lady Aethelflaed arrives, she will persuade Edward to endure a longer siege.
You know that we can take back the town when they’re depleted.
That is not my plan, Aldhelm. Ha! Told you.
Why else would you make such a dangerous offer?
Because I believe I can end this.
Sigtryggr!
Show yourself!
But I killed him...
What?
We...
We have tried to kill him.
And yet here he is... returned from the dead, like their nailed god.
And not for the first time, I hear.
I have learned a lot about him from his daughter.
We will not retreat, Sigtryggr!
Instead, we make you this offer.
Send out both the children... and I will walk into Winchester alone.
And why would I exchange gold for silver?
Because you will have the Saxons' greatest warrior!
And because you know that, in time, I would kill you... as I have killed your friends and your brothers.
Is he lying?
No.
What his daughter said is true.
We cannot conquer this place while he lives.
Edward can make other heirs.
He cannot make another Uhtred.
Then perhaps we should tear him to pieces.
Make the exchange.
How long do we give him?
As long as he needs.
We’ll know when the time comes.
Your king could not choose between his sons.
And so...
Guards, bring in the prisoner!
He has given us his greatest warrior in their place!
Bring him to me.
I did not know about the child.
Neither did Cnut.
All will be avenged when you suffer as I have suffered.
Tie him to the crucifix in the marketplace!
Let him die like the Christian he tries to be!
In time, Brida. Huh?
Take him to the hall. What? Sigtryggr...
Sigtryggr! We agreed.
I swear that you shall have him when I am finished with him.
On my honor.
His sword.
Return the captive to the chapel and feed them.
I need them alive... for now.
Do you like this?
Then I need your help.
I don’t want his sword! I want him!
You’ll have your revenge, Brida. Sigtryggr!
Hm.
What does this mean?
Why this sudden kindness?
Sigtryggr toys with us.
Whether it means a reprieve, I do not know.
Well, the children are safe.
That is enough for now.
Let us break bread and be thankful.
Drink enough water, then give me back the jug.
After that point, do not drink anymore.
Why?
If the King cannot choose between his sons, it may be that we need to ensure Aethelstan does not have a powerful friend.
You are fast.
I think you are not trying.
Why would I not try? When you are the killer of so many of my kin?
That is a question only you can answer.
Perhaps your reputation is exaggerated.
I've been reading his chronicle.
You are not in it.
Alfred did not want it known how much he owed to a heathen.
If you are not of their God, then why do you choose them?
They are my people. And they accept you as such?
Many heathens live here in peace.
It is only the Kings who cannot find accord.
Oh.
Interesting.
Your daughter, she said the same.
Where is she?
She is here.
She’s been well-treated.
Hm, I see the Dane in her.
She has not been dishonored, I swear to that.
No, your daughter is a very intelligent young woman... which she apparently gets from her mother.
We've talked a great deal.
She has told me much about you... how you fought for peace in Mercia... how you gave up the woman you loved.
But my favorite tale was how you lost your home at Bebbanburg.
Why is that of interest?
Because I too have lost a home.
And, so, I wonder if that puts us on common ground.
Do you wish to strike a bargain?
Is that why you have not killed me?
Why not approach the King?
Because the King is not a decisive man and men like that, they cannot negotiate.
You, on the other hand, you offered your lover to preserve a kingdom.
So, I presume you can make difficult choices.
Hm?
But I have nothing to give. But you have influence with those who do.
And they follow you.
What is it you want?
Peace.
Or peace and land.
And you try to find peace by starting a war?
Where is the battle?
Where is the war?
I guessed you wanted to negotiate.
The king would not believe it.
Who told you that I would be willing to strike a bargain?
Oh, you did... when you chose to enter the town.
The offer had been made.
All we have to do is get Edward to agree to a meeting... and argue the terms.
Haesten! Are you spying on them?
I spy on everyone.
What is he doing with him?
I fear to tell you.
Haesten, what’s happening in there?
You should know...
Sigtryggr seeks a truce.
That is a good thing, Brida.
It means more land, more silver.
It means betrayal.
You are foolish.
This could soon be over.
Cowards.
Liars and cowards all of you!
Go in the north. You need good weather to go through there.
Why don’t you go up to Eoferwic?
Well, I don’t think this is going to work.
Do not lose faith. He will have survived.
Lord.
No, I'm begging, Lord King, just give him more time.
Do not attack whilst he is within. Please, Lord.
This does not mean the end. My Lord.
Lord King, we have followed Uhtred for years.
He’s never failed!
He never failed because good men followed him.
But even he could not take on an army alone.
It was unwise.
It is painful to speak it, but your Lord has lost a battle he could never win.
There is no hope for him.
Lord King! Our scouts send good news!
The Lady of Mercia has come. She brings an army!
The King is trying to be bold, but his decisions are rash.
I'm certain that with more time, the siege can be ended without slaughter.
Edward, I have heard the boys have been freed.
One mercy has been shown, yes. I hear Danes have submitted in the north.
Yes. And what has been done once can be done twice.
If you have your sons, you have everything you need for Alfred's line to thrive.
Walls can be rebuilt, palaces, even tombs.
Edward, you are Wessex.
Whatever you decide, Mercia will support you.
He cannot lose Winchester. It would rip out our father's heart.
We should not put it above the lives of innocents.
No, Aethelflaed is right. How many people are within?
Many. And there are those, of course, inside of royal blood, my wife, our mother.
Mother would not want you to capitulate.
She is by father's side and will be reconciled to dying.
Then we shall proceed, but not as they expect.
They have made provisions against fire, so, let us use smoke to conceal an attack.
If God and the winds are in our favor, it will choke those guarding the gates and allow us to breach the walls.
But if the wind turns, then we ourselves are smothered.
Lady, I beg you.
Give Lord Uhtred more time. Lord Uhtred is already dead.
dead or alive, it does not matter.
We cannot hand Winchester over to the Danes for the life of one man.
Indeed.
Set the hay sacks close to the gates.
Add shit and lime, so they may choke on the stench.
We force men from the ramparts and into the streets, breach the gates and slaughter them!
Here.
Are you leaving?
Yes.
They are at the gates and I do not want to be here for the fight.
And you are coming with me. No. No, no, I cannot.
They will be slaughtered!
Come with me.
Many women have grown to appreciate my charms, given a year or so.
Get back!
Down there.
Will we get out? Yes!
Save yourself from what will follow.
No!
You will not survive the fight!
We have no time for this!
Stay and you die!
My place is with the captive!
Ah, die, then, ungrateful bitch!
Edward has attacked us.
Come with me.
Uhtred.
You betray me, all will suffer.
Quickly! Get back!
One formation!
Pull back! Protect your men! Keep tight!
Let me speak with him. Let me speak with the King.
Go with this man. If he kills Danes, kill him.
Stand down your men!
Edward, stand down!
Stand down!
Edward!
Edward! Edward!
Lord, you must trust me! I spoke to him.
Edward, stop this fight!
It's too late! Trust me!
Sigtryggr is willing to negotiate! Why would I lie to you?
I have spoken to him. He will stand down!
Winchester is going to burn!
Sigtryggr! Stand down your men!
Order the shield wall! Do it now!
Did you get what you came for?
Sigtryggr! Stand down your men!
You can get what you came for!
Shield wall!
Shield wall!
Shield wall!
Get back!
Hold the line! Back!
Dear God!
Stay back!
Please.
Eadith. Eadith.
Stay back.
Finan!
She's all right. Come on.
Move!
Get back! Get back! Move!
Hold the line! Hold the lines! You heard him!
Sigtryggr, you wish to talk with us?
There will be no negotiation until we see the captive.
Welcome.
Uhtred tells me you have gone north.
I want Eoferwic and the lands that surround it.
No, we have just recaptured Eoferwic. Which is why I want it.
For decades, we have fought to push Danes from there.
To give it to you would set us back a generation.
Then I will keep Winchester.
We can offer you East Anglia.
It is bigger and has access to your homeland from the sea.
I want Eoferwic.
I cannot agree.
It is unclear what your choices are.
Perhaps we should consider it. He would be on my border!
Edward, do not let him divide us.
I will leave you to trade between yourselves.
I’ll find my daughter.
Did you think I would forget you?
Stop this! It is over.
It is never over.
Brida! I spared your life!
You destroyed my life!
You know nothing of how I suffered!
I will not kill you, nor Cnut's child.
He is not Cnut's. He is mine alone!
And he will be loyal to me, as no man ever has!
I will breed in him a hatred of all Saxons.
Then you condemn your child to a bloody death and that will undo you!
Fight on and they will kill you!
If not the Saxon kings, then Sigtryggr himself.
But I am not afraid of that.
I have not lost faith in what comes after.
Do it!
Do it!
kill me.
If you do not, I will become stronger.
Blood has been shed. More will flow.
I will take revenge on all of those who have betrayed me and I will not rest until they suffer at my hand.
Do it!
Or I will be your undoing.
Just leave.
Have your child.
Leave while you can.
I never know where she is.
Careful, Osferth!
Have you struck a bargain?
He... He will take Eoferwic... and agree never to enter Wessex, Mercia or East Anglia.
So, you hold three of the four Kingdoms.
That is no humiliation.
Sigtryggr would like to take one of the captive.
Your daughter.
Which you have refused.
Because you know what it is to have your child used in a bargain!
Stiorra is not a child.
She is a young woman.
So, we did not refuse.
I thought I'd lost you.
I'll miss you.
Why?
When I leave.
I have said no.
But I'm... I'm willing to go.
With Sigtryggr?
But I want you with me in Coccham. There’s nothing for me in Coccham.
It’s the chance for us to be one family.
It’s not what either of us wants.
You’d like it to be true, but it’s not. Your men are your family.
I want my children with me.
Maybe in Bebbanburg.
Maybe then, but you’re not destined to be the Lord of Coccham any more than I’m meant to live a small life there.
We’re wanderers, Father.
We follow where the gods lead us and the gods are sending me to Daneland.
Let me go... for the sake of all Saxons.
I have sacrificed enough for them. Well, I have sacrificed nothing.
Please! I want to live amongst my mother's people, to... find the part of myself that died when she was taken from me.
Besides...
Sigtryggr is gentle.
He's a man of honor!
You are mine to take care of.
For too long, you’ve had nothing from me.
I’ve had everything from you.
Your blood is within me and it’s made me a restless spirit.
Please give me this chance to live as you do, to follow a path without having certainty of where it’s going to end.
Let me go.
How did you like your first battle?
I swear it will be my last.
From now on, I will be staying in the tent.
You showed the spirit of a true warrior.
Perhaps my family honor is restored.
If only those who cared for me were still here to see it.
Rest. It is over.
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
My mother is taken ill.
I fear the Danes have claimed another life.
She's strong.
My mother cannot care for him.
How could I?
Please, Uhtred. I know you will not swear to me, but this child deserves more than a monastery.
He is a brave and a goodhearted boy, but he will need guidance.
Protect him and take him to safety.
One aetheling is enough for Winchester.
Bring him within the palace, it would create a strife to rival that of Aethelwold.
That is politics.
What would you have me do with him?
Teach him how to be a warrior and all you know of the Danes.
Teach him of Northumbria.
You have just sworn you will not fight for Northumbria.
There are ways to take lands without fighting for them.
Sigtryggr has shown us this.
Northumbria is the last kingdom.
Without it under one King and under Christ, there will be no England.
It is hard for a father to see his daughter go.
But you were right, Father. Sigtryggr is different.
Perhaps I was not so foolish.
Or someone was guiding you.
The gods like to see me fight.
It is sport to them.
I will return to my church, Father.
I curse myself for my headstrong children.
What can I say? My blood is the blood of a stubborn bastard.
So, in the reign of King Edward, peace broke out between Saxon and Dane.
And though it was not for the first time, there was a sense the truce would last.
But at what cost?
Ambition stalks the Saxon palaces.
In time, the King must choose his heir and the bonds of blood may be tested.
Brothers may be torn apart... but a throne cannot stay empty.
I now stand alone with nothing but my sword.
I failed in securing my birthright.
I have given up the woman I love.
My family are dispersed... perhaps never to be reunited... scattered far across the Saxon kingdoms.
As a new feud is born, revenge is certain to grow stronger.
I have sworn to protect a bastard child... whose path, I fear, is entwined with that of this great land.
And though I have refused the service of Saxon Kings, it may only be a matter of time before fate draws me back into their plans.
Destiny is all!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SEASON: 04
EPISODE: 09
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred.
The battle for influence threat to break old alliances.
Edward is acting as if Mercia is his kingdom and it is not!
Perhaps being so far from home has clouded your judgment.
Return to Winchester and all will be well.
As power shifts in Wessex, Aelswith sees her plans take hold.
I would like to take Aethelstan to Bedwyn and raise him there.
Make the arrangements. I will ask Uhtred to accompany you.
Eardwulf’s treachery has been exposed by his sister.
Save yourself.
Without allies, he seeks those who also desire revenge.
He is the turd who will help us take Winchester without a single drop of Danish blood being shed.
I accepted an offer to rule Mercia.
At long last I strike a bargain with Uhtred of Bebbanburg.
But I knew of a person more deserving.
As my first act as Lord of Mercia...
I feel I have no choice but to relinquish the throne...
...in favor of Lady Aethelflaed!
Lady Aethelflaed cannot rule Mercia!
Yet it was not without sacrifice.
I swear that as long as I hold the Mercian throne, I will remain chaste.
Is the Witan agreed? Agreed!
Then Lady Aethelflaed, take your throne.
Destiny is all!
I will miss you, Uhtred Ragnarson.
Long live, Lady Aethelflaed!
What is that?
Guards!
Take the priests.
Don’t let them kill us.
I've been told you are in charge.
I am not the King.
I'm aware you're not the king.
Would you like to fight or to yield?
Yield.
Lock them up.
Do we hold the town? Soon enough.
We have ripped out the Saxon heart.
So, it begins!
Ready yourselves. Take your positions.
Am I the only one doing any work here?
If I make the fire, I’m not doing the cooking.
It’s such a privilege to set up camp for Lady Aelswith.
Oh, yes. Edward honors us...
...escorting his mother.
When I arrive at Bedwyn, I will offer prayers of thanks on your behalf.
Yet I fear I will not be thankful.
God worked through you, Uhtred. You did not make your sacrifice alone.
It was no sacrifice, no blood was spilt.
Pyrlig, flint!
Yet you gave what was most precious to you to the Mercian people.
And for that, I will always be grateful.
Are you Lady Aelswith’s man now?
If you would turn to Christ, perhaps, I could find a way to reward you properly.
Then I shall go un-rewarded. I will not pretend a faith I do not have.
Whilst it is unlikely that you and I will be friends...
I do now see how you might be of use to me.
That is indeed touching.
I meant in accomplishing the work my husband started.
I know now that it means something to you... and I thought, if we could work together, then perhaps...
I cannot be part of your plan. I have my own children to look to.
What do you intend for the boy?
Nothing. I just want to bring up Alfred's bloodline, appropriately.
Is that not right, Father Pyrlig?
Uh, that is indeed what you say.
I thought you were not interested in her plan.
I am not. I’ve played my part.
The Dane-Slayer is now a Man of Peace.
It is a great pity Alfred is not here to witness it.
My husband saw things in Uhtred none of us understood.
Lady, we all understood it. I think it was just you that didn't.
That will not be enough. I feel the cold.
Please go and cut some more.
Of course, Lady.
It’s her way of showing she likes you.
Yeah.
How long until we reach Bedwyn? With luck by tomorrow, if we do not keep stopping on the road to pray.
Then we will go on to Coccham. Mm.
Is that not good news? It is.
I do want to live alongside you, Father.
It’s just... Coccham is small.
And peaceful and safe.
Could we not go to Winchester? We were happy there.
Have those riders been following us?
No. We are just on a trading route.
And what about them?
Lord!
What do they want?
We will see.
Stay calm.
Looks like an ambush.
Most definitely is an ambush.
Uhtred, what a surprise!
I heard you were heading south, but I didn’t believe it.
As ever, the gods are with you.
We were in wait for the King.
But now you will have to do.
What do you want from us, Haesten?
A gift, for my new lord.
And who has this misfortune?
Sigtryggr, the kin of Ivar the Boneless.
A boy without reputation.
Reputation will come.
He has landed from Irland and he wants all Danes to follow him.
He delivered Brida from Wealas and she has joined.
She joined with Cnut.
That did not go well for her.
You've sworn to a boy, Haesten.
Indeed. He is young.
But... he is cunning.
Whilst you played Lord and the Saxons fought amongst themselves, he...
captured Winchester!
No! Yes! Lady Aelswith, you’re going home!
Take the girl, too.
No. You will not fight it!
Huh, I did not know you cared so much for Alfred’s widow.
Come now, Uhtred, we’re even. Hm?
You took Cnut's boys from me. I take these captive from you.
Lord!
Lord!
Listen to that pig squeal. Lord, what do we do?
We have to get out of this alive.
Tie them. Leave them to die, slowly.
Sigtryggr wants you dead.
Then take me to him.
I will be happy to fight him.
And give him the reputation as the man who killed the Dane-Slayer?
No.
I want that honor to be mine.
I fear it is too soon to leave.
Should you not take the moment to place your authority in Mercia?
If Eoferwic is vulnerable, we have an opportunity we cannot waste.
Then I shall come. I cannot let you take them on alone.
Edward, please, I have the men and the silver to do this for us both.
You have spent too much time in Mercia and, as much as my men respect you, one leader is enough for any army.
It is agreed. I will return to Wessex and Mercia has a Lady to make her proud.
Thank you.
I promise I will bring the troops to Winchester as soon as we have secured the northern border.
And we will welcome your men as brothers. I mean it.
We take Eoferwic and our father's dream is revived.
We banish the Danes within our lifetime.
Oh! I am told this is a peaceful way to die.
You go into something of a sleep, like a night with too much ale.
It will give you a chance to dream, Uhtred.
And how you were finally defeated...
...by the mighty Haesten!
Oh-ho-ho!
Oh!
Oh, such a great warrior, huh?
Here's your sword. Come and retrieve it.
No?
You two, stay here and report which one dies first.
And if they take too long to die, slit their throats like hogs.
Yes, Haesten.
Come, we return the Queen to her palace and finally get to see how much King Edward really loves his mother.
Calm down, Sihtric.
You will need your energy.
Look at him, stealing from the dead.
Does he not feel rewarded?
It certainly suggests he does not trust us, which is probably wise of him.
I do not like him. He is too fawning.
Yes, he’s an arse-licker. Hm.
But his word was good and now we have the prize.
We should make a plan.
A plan for?
How we destroy them... the town, their holy places... everything that makes them who they are.
And what makes Edward who he is?
He’s not the enemy his father was, but like all Saxons, he’s made weak by his God.
Hurt their faith and you hurt them.
Start with their dead.
Unbury them. Dig them up. They will hate that.
Hm, I think we wait, see how they react. And let the Saxons take the lead?
You let them take the lead, they reveal who their true leaders are.
And then you take those men first.
And then we will be taking the Dane-Slayer.
And you will get what you want.
Sihtric.
Sihtric. Yes.
Stay awake.
Sihtric! Stay awake!
Okay, look at me. You’ll be fine.
Lambs waiting for the slaughter.
Huh?
I'll go.
Can you reach the knot? The ropes are too tight.
Lady?
Orm!
Orm?
Where are you?
Orm?
Orm, where did you go?
Orm?
Orm!
I tried.
Eadith, quickly! Go to Sihtric. All right.
That’s it. Release his hands first.
Faster.
Hurry up.
Make him fall, why don’t you?
Thank you! Pyrlig next. Is he?
Wake up, Sihtric!
You're safe.
kill him, Sihtric!
kill the bastard!
Oh, thank you.
You’re an angel.
Coming, Lord.
Move! They cannot have taken them far!
...They’ve taken the horses, Lord. Ah!
We must get to Stiorra!
Lord, they do not know she’s your daughter.
Pyrlig, find Edward. Tell him what has happened here.
Yes, Lord. We go ahead to Winchester.
They will not take what is not theirs, not whilst I live!
Lord! What?
Run!
Let’s go.
What?
Hm?
I want to strike a bargain. I am a very rich man.
And?
And I can offer you more silver than you...
I have lived without the comfort of silver.
I only want one thing and that you cannot give.
What? Perhaps. Revenge.
Oh. On whom?
All of you.
I get to Winchester at last.
Do not look on it. It is not the place I left.
Be under no illusion. They will murder us. So, I suggest you say your prayers and thank the Lord for the lives you’ve led.
I will not. I'm not a Christian.
Speak nothing of how we vanquished the Dane-Slayer.
We collect our reward from Sigtryggr and leave this place with silver.
Only then do we let it be known who the true warriors are!
Lady Aelswith.
I’m so happy to see your family re-united.
I want to speak with whoever leads you.
I lead here.
I mean, the man in charge of this.
Do not insult me.
I am not the one using insults.
But I am giving you a warning.
This incursion will not be tolerated.
My son will burn us all to the ground... before he concedes one square of Wessex land.
You are a pack of fools... unknowingly, you have trapped yourselves within these walls.
For once, the heathen are all in one place.
And when the fire comes, as come it shall... we will watch your souls burn as we ascend!
Have her servant girl feed her shit.
torture me by all means, but you must know that she and the boy are Danes.
They were taken, as slaves, after our victory at Tettanhall.
If you value your people, take them back.
Who is Sjofn?
Handmaiden of Frigga.
She is half Dane at most.
The monk boy not at all.
Half Dane is enough. Hold the young woman separately.
She’s Uhtred's daughter. I recognize her.
We met in Mercia when my sister betrayed me.
I’ve never seen you before.
Of course, she has his look. And she is cunning like him.
Find Uhtred. Send him her head.
No! Do it. It will bring him.
It will bring them all and the end will begin!
What?
I thought you welcomed the fire.
Put the Queen and the others back where they keep their dead king.
She comes with me.
What is it?
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Oh, dear God! Quick, up on the ramparts.
This does not mean they’re dead.
Stiorra's strong. She'll have kept herself hidden.
Why have they strengthened their defenses?
They could be preparing for a siege.
I thought that Danes did not like sieges. Yes.
Perhaps Sigtryggr learned something in Irland.
He's cunning. Maybe he changes the strategy.
Strategy or not, there’s too many of them.
What if we cannot find a way in?
If Sigtryggr fought the Irish, he’ll know what hard bastards we are and how we do not give up, even when it looks completely impossible.
Do not.
I will not harm you. Do not.
I only wish to speak with you.
Answer me truthfully and I will treat you kindly.
I’ve heard of men's kindness and I do not want it.
I am the Dane who took Winchester.
If I wanted to hump a woman, I would not need to use force.
Who was your mother?
Gisela, sister of Guthred of Northumbria.
Oh, so we share the same ancestors.
Yet we’re not the same.
And where is your home?
Bebbanburg.
A young woman with land in the north.
Our lands were stolen, but my father will see them restored.
Hm, so, are you one of us, or one of them?
I’m both!
As are many living here, two generations, three.
This foolishness of who is Saxon and who is Dane!
When one side seeks to destroy the other, you must choose in order to survive.
Well, I refuse. It’s a game for old men.
I won’t be held to the feuds from years ago.
I have no fight with either side and I will not choose.
It would dishonor either my father or my mother.
Well, then, I would say this love of honor makes you a Dane.
The Saxon cares only for obedience to their God.
Then you know nothing of Saxons.
They treasure honor as much as you do.
Yet they say their god is the god of peace.
Do you also believe them when they say their god came back from the dead?
Do you think there could be peace between Saxon and Dane?
They are new to me. I wish to understand their ways.
Many would like there to be.
Tell me of your father Uhtred.
Why does he hate us?
He doesn't. Then why does he kill so many of my kin?
Why does he revel in his title Dane-Slayer?
He doesn’t revel in it. He hates it.
You speak like a man who’s never killed.
Oh, I have killed, but only Christians.
I would never betray my people.
He’s never betrayed anyone.
He was often torn between those who loved him like their own and those were his blood.
My mother was a Dane and he loved her.
If Uhtred were intent on destroying the Danes, to clean us from the land, why am I here to speak of it?
We could enter with those villagers. We should do it now then.
If they get that food in and close the gate.
But, Lord, you are known here.
We’re all known here. This plan will not work.
Someone would betray us in return for their own safety.
I could go in.
I’ve not been here. I will not be noticed.
It is a journey with no quick return.
I can survive a siege. I will find out where the captive are being kept and when you breach the walls, you will know where to look for them.
That could save them if it comes to a fight.
Mm.
Uh, you do not have to do this.
No, no, I will.
We will get you provisions. You cannot go empty handed.
They will close the gates. There will be no way out.
I know. It will bring them comfort to know that you are here.
To Wessex.
Both?
If they are... Both my heirs?
Lord, assuming Aelfweard was at the palace with the Queen, yes.
Why... why did Uhtred not protect those on the road?
He tried. There were too many to fight off.
Too many...
Did... did someone betray me?
Betray, Lord? The Danes do not act by stealth!
Lord...
They must have been told we were absent from Winchester.
Lord, your presence in Mercia was never hidden.
Are you suggesting it is my fault?
Hm?
That I have failed my people worse than any king, hm?
That I am more stupid and more foolish than any who came before me?
Ready my men. Raise the Fyrd!
Raise the Mercian Guard!
Raise the dead for all I care!
Winchester will be retaken!
Perhaps this man was a great warrior. What do you think?
I demand you make them stop this! Why?
This is clearly wrong! This is sacrilege!
But I am not a Christian. So?
Please, let these men rest peacefully.
I knew some of them. I fought alongside them.
I may have abandoned the Lords of Mercia, but I never abandoned simple warriors!
So, you lie to yourself, as well as everyone else!
You do not get to choose which Saxons you’ve betrayed.
You’ve spat on all of them and now you must watch us do worse.
I have not spat!
I was forced to.
No one forced you. You begged us.
And as I said, I’m not a Christian.
And I'm yet to meet people who welcome traitors.
So, be glad these men are dead, so they can’t witness what you’ve become a part of.
Go.
Here.
I will never forgive this.
And I will never forgive the king. If he had not abandoned...
Cnut and Sigtryggr would have joined and the threat we face would be double. Do you think that...
Hello.
Tell me, you’re far too young and too noble looking to be a servant to her, so, why were you traveling with the Lady Aelswith?
I'm to be educated at Bedwyn.
She must like you very much.
My name is Lord Aethelhelm. What’s yours?
I’ve been told not to answer that.
You can tell me.
The king’s my friend.
Aethelstan?
Is that your name?
No.
I think it could be.
Why have you brought the King's bastard to Wessex?
Because the King has asked me to.
The king would not do that.
The child has no more status than any son of a whore.
Well, perhaps you do not know his wishes as I do!
If we escape this, it will be righted.
But you will not escape this.
So, I suggest you focus on your account with God.
And perhaps you should reflect on your anger towards a poor child.
Aethelstan, come.
Look on your grandfather, King Alfred.
He was as strong as this stone... but his eyes were very warm and bright.
His intelligence shone through him, as it shines through you.
Danes come for us to prise us from our God.
In those times, we hold steadfast to our Lord and do not buckle.
We may not survive this... but our kingdom will and that is all that matters.
Our sense of history is who we are.
It is how God separated us from the animals.
And I will not be treated as an animal.
Have we sent Eadith to her death?
I do not think so.
What now, then?
We have to wait for Edward.
Oh, come on!
Since when do we sit on our arses waiting for royalty?
Since a boy with no reputation came out of nowhere and took the biggest prize.
Do you think I want to wait here when my daughter’s within?
If they discover who she is, they will kill her.
So, act now, Lord, before it’s too late.
Take them on with swords?
I do not yet know how to win against him.
Hey, what happened to the man who always ran into battle?
I lost Beocca in my haste at Bebbanburg.
Understand if I try to find a more cautious path.
Hm.
I'll be quiet.
I’m an arseling.
We care for the people within.
It puts us at a disadvantage.
I’ve been drinking ale.
I know.
What do you want?
To kill someone, I think.
Someone or myself, one of the two.
Sigtryggr wants me as a hostage.
I am of use to him alive.
Oh, don’t be fooled.
He’s playing with you.
Unlike myself, he’s a man bereft of conscience.
Then don’t anger him by killing me.
If you want favor amongst the Danes...
I don’t want favor amongst the Danes!
Making a bargain with them was madness. I can see that now.
I will suffer whatever I choose.
So, I might as well take pleasure in a small scrap of vengeance.
I have done nothing to you.
Your father turned my sister from me.
Your father, Lady Aethelflaed, the King, all of them, stole my chance to regain my honor.
Pushed my face in the dirt when all I wanted was to take back what was owed.
Do you know what it is to live your life derided?
To be forced to turn from your people to survive?
Do you know what that does to a man?
Turns him into a drunk?
Do not mock me.
Then don’t be pitiful.
All this you brought upon yourself. You know that.
Is this how we play now?
We strike those weaker than ourselves?
Go on. I like this game.
She’s defiant and she does not fear me. Is that how Saxons are controlled?
I don’t understand you.
In Saxon lands, are people subdued through fear?
Are not all people subdued by fear? Was this how Alfred thrived?
Yes. No! Alfred was loved!
Look at how they honor him.
And what of your Lord Aethelred whom you abandoned to choose a life with me?
Aethelred was loved and feared.
Not by you. You killed him in his bed.
It’s why he ran from Mercia.
Is this true? No, why would you believe a captive girl?
You lie worse than a child.
So, you killed the man whom you'd sworn allegiance to?
I knew there was something untrustworthy about you.
I brought you here. You can trust me. I’ve proved it.
And how should I rule here?
By fear?
Or by love?
I would always choose fear.
Sigtryggr, please! No.
Sigtryggr.
Arse-licker, did you fall in the shit?
They cut off your tongue.
What did he do? He works to his own plan.
We need to be of one mind when the time comes.
He’s playing with you.
The man is cold, but he will make a show of mercy.
I’ve come to know him.
We take this place because we seek a homeland!
We work as one to achieve this common good!
When we fight... we fight with one heart to terrify the Saxons!
But we do not succumb to anger.
And at all times we are united, unlike our forebears... the men who tried and failed.
Ubba, Bloodhair, Cnut... all taken in anger, as they tried to pursue their own glory.
This is the way of the old generation.
And there is no longer a place for it.
This man...
This man...
is a man of ambition.
There’s nothing wrong with that.
We should all have ambition.
But he works only for himself and his own desires.
And this ambition... is a poison... a poison that has the power to seep!
And we must not let his venom spread amongst us. Yes.
So, let this man's fate serve as a warning, for the danger of anger and ambition.
No.
No, no, no, please, please, please.
I can't die, please.
Please spare this repentant sinner, God. Please!
Forgive me for I...
Forgive my sins, so that my soul can be saved, Lord God.
Have mercy!
Who weeps for you?
Who has this faith?
She’s a whore I once knew.
She is nothing. Discard her.
You dare speak against the greatest warriors who ever walked this land?
Huh? If they were the greatest... then where are they now?
Psst!
What are you doing?
I was asked to bring food to the captive.
You are almost convincing.
I think...
...you could be his sister.
Eardwulf was not a man of lust and he spoke of no one else who cared for him.
Are you not the woman who humped Aethelred for silver?
I do not know who you speak of.
Come. Where are you taking me?
Somewhere Sigtryggr won’t find you.
You do not want to suffer your brother’s fate.
Is that our chance to get in?
Perhaps, if they have more dead to bring out.
Finan, move!
Send word to Sigtryggr!
Charge down those gates! Show them the face of death!
Show them no fear!
It makes no sense.
Dismount!
Archers ready!
Let’s take back what is rightfully ours!
That way to the walls. Archers.
We have to stop them, Lord, before it gets them all killed!
Stain the ground with their blood!
Pull back!
Pull back!
Stop! Hold with your king!
Men are coming from every corner of the Saxon kingdom!
By dawn tomorrow, you will be surrounded!
Surrender now and avoid being massacred!
Up shield!
Build the shield wall! Move, move, move!
Lord King!
Lord King! Hold back. Sigtryggr fights another way.
We need a better plan.
Do you surrender?
Do nothing.
The walls will hold. The fool built them strong.
Listen to me! Do not do this!
attack! No!

SEASON: 04
EPISODE: 08
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred.
In Wealas, King Hywel and his brother Rhodri believe victory at Tettenhall has brought peace.
I'm going on a pilgrimage and you can rule from the fortress in my absence.
But a new Dane warrior will harness Brida's fury against the Saxons.
I do not know you. Cnut's cousin. Sigtryggr of Irland.
It is Cnut's babe you carry, or that of a Welshman?
I have returned to Aegelesburg with the truth of Eardwulf's treachery.
Eardwulf has confessed to the murder of Lord Aethelred and he has fled Mercia.
Thanks to the kindness of those loyal to her, Aethelflaed has been reunited with her daughter.
A miracle has occurred and you are mistaken in your heartbreak.
I hope that my love for Aethelflaed will be allowed to flourish.
To live in peace by your side, to raise my daughter in safety, nothing would bring me greater happiness.
Yet, with an empty throne...
Calm yourselves!
... Mercia remains in turmoil.
Edward's heart hardens further, even against his own son.
He is Aethelstan. He cannot be here.
And my fate has changed with an unexpected offer.
If I place someone to rule here who might forge a path to peace, I wondered if that person should be you.
To Uhtred of Mercia!
Uhtred of Mercia!
Destiny is all!
Go.
Danes!
Danes!
Burn it.
We have everything gathered.
Move!
Back to the fort.
Out surveying your kingdom, Lord Uhtred?
I do not wish to argue. Then do not go through with this.
You are not the right person to rule Mercia.
How can you be certain?
You are wild and impetuous, ruled by your heart and instinct.
And these are all things I love about you.
But it is not what Mercia requires of a ruler right now.
It needs someone considered and diplomatic who can rebuild the kingdom and forge alliances that are equal.
I can be diplomatic when it is required.
Mercia needs a ruler who is not a tyrant, imposed by Wessex.
That is how it will appear if you are Edward's choice to be Lord and Protector of Mercia.
This is the best we can do for Mercia right now.
Another Lord may not feel as well disposed to you.
You could be banished.
That is true.
And still, you would prefer it than I take the throne?
If you are asking me to choose between a Lord who is best for me or one who is best for Mercia, I will choose one who is best for Mercia.
Mercia's needs are greater than mine.
I did this for you. I know.
So that you and Aelfwynn would be safe.
If I am ruler of Mercia, I can protect you.
I appreciate all you have done for us, Uhtred. But it does not change my conviction that Mercia needs a ruler who is independent of Wessex.
Apologies, I can return if you wish. I was just leaving, Father.
I know you will do what is right.
What is so important? I wanted to discuss your baptism.
The Lord of Mercia must be Christian. It is written.
I have been baptized by Father Beocca.
Twice. That was many years ago, and the life you've lived since has not been very Christian, so, some of the Ealdormen wish to witness your baptism in person.
Is my word not enough?
If there are doubts, why not give the Ealdormen the proof they require?
Is the prospect of inviting God into your heart again really so abhorrent that you are willing to give up...
No. ...the opportunity to be ruler of Mercia.
Fine! Resolve all of this?
I will get baptized... again!
For the third time.
Good.
This will be a great home for us.
We can rest here for a while.
Brida! Where are all the women?
Welsh women fight back. We had to kill them.
You did well.
With this and what we've already gathered, we have more than enough to leave here.
Leave and go where?
To Wessex or Mercia. I'm tired of killing farmers and their wives.
My men have traveled from Irland after months of battle.
They are tired. And where better to rest than here?
We have food. We are safe.
There's no reason to leave.
Edward and Uhtred slaughtered our kin. They must pay for that.
And they will. When?
When the time is right.
I did not keep myself alive in that hole in the ground to watch your men get fat here while the Saxons grow stronger.
They are weak now after Tettenhall. They will not expect us to attack.
You have a warrior's spirit, and this is good.
But if I ask my men to fight, it must be for a reason I believe in.
They will fight to protect their families, or for food, or for land.
But vengeance for Tettenhall... it is not enough.
I will go to find our allies to the north. They will fight the Saxons.
Then that is what you must do.
I need ten men to escort me on my journey.
You owe me that.
You can have five.
Look how high I can go, I can go higher. Nearly touch the sky!
Lady Aethelflaed. You can sit.
No, I am higher...
I was wrong to doubt you.
You delivered my message to Lord Uhtred as you said you would.
I was happy to be of assistance.
And I am told you cared for Aelfwynn on the road, cooled her fever.
She is a fearless child.
It must be in her blood.
The child is fond of you. And I her.
Perhaps I could be of use to her here.
I am curious.
Why did you reveal Eardwulf as Aethelred's murder?
Uh...
Eardwulf may be my brother, but I knew what he did was wrong.
I choose to be loyal to you and Lord Uhtred because I believe in what you and he are doing.
I thought you would be happy to see me baptized.
I would, if I believed you were sincere in accepting God into your heart.
Do you worry if every child baptized is sincere in accepting God into their heart?
I'm confident few of them are using it to lay claim to a throne.
God is infinitely wise, is he not?
He will know if I am sincere.
Lord Uhtred, come forward and receive God's grace.
Up! Up! Up! Down!
As I am leaving, does anybody want my dog?
Does anybody want my dog?!
All you have to do is feed him and water him. And beat him!
beat him every day!
Up you get. Move!
Do you want a dog?
Nobody wants you, dog.
I know you have your doubts about Lord Uhtred, but I am confident it is the right decision.
It is not that I doubt him.
I just cannot forget that he held a knife to your father's throat and threat to kill him.
Lord God, drive from Uhtred all the blindness of his heart.
We ask you, Lord, to mercifully hear our prayers and protect Uhtred.
We mark him with the sign of your cross.
God, who is creator of all people, let us rejoice in the gift of grace bestowed on Uhtred that he could not attain on this earth, but only by divine blessing.
You are now catechumen.
I ask your sponsor to come forward.
Receive your servant Uhtred into the ranks of your devout saints and most bright angels.
Let the water cleanse him so that he may know your wisdom to do what is just.
Uhtred, you are now a child of God.
Amen. Amen.
Yes!
I don't think I can stomach another drop of ale, Finan.
Whoa-oh! Everyone knows you cure like with like.
So, only more ale will make you feel better.
Makes perfect sense.
Let me introduce to you the new Lord of Mercia's most trusted advisors.
Mm, they do not look like Lord's advisors to me.
How many advisors have you met?
None, I suppose. Well, this is what they look like.
Now, fill our cups with ale, and we'll tell you what great plans we have for Mercia.
Hey, hey, hey. Stay awake.
Mm.
Mmm! Mm.
Not hers.
She will have milk. What?
I'm not incurring the wrath of the Lord and Protector of Mercia on his first day...
Are you ready to serve?
I am, Lord King.
After the Witan, you and I should speak alone.
I wish to share with you my plans on how the alliance between Wessex and Mercia is to proceed.
It is important you know exactly what needs to be done.
Yes, Lord King.
It is done, Aethelflaed. Accept it.
Uhtred has been baptized and will be the Lord of Mercia.
And it is not the worst outcome.
I recall a time you wished Uhtred dead! I did.
But your father saw something in Uhtred that I was blind to.
Alfred was a wise judge of character.
Uhtred is a good man, but he is not the right man.
He is being forced on Mercia by my brother, and that cannot be accepted.
The Witan will decide who rules Mercia, not Edward.
You know that is nonsense!
Edward is acting as if Mercia is his kingdom, and it is not.
We are his allies, not his subjects. He needs to accept that.
Your brother is doing what he believes is best.
Best for him, not Mercia.
Is it so much to wish that Mercia have a ruler that has not been selected by Wessex?
You can wish, but that is all.
These decisions are not made by us.
You think I would not have liked a greater voice, instead of having to stand there quietly while men blithely make foolish decisions?
This is our lot.
They are gathering.
Dear God...
Lord King?
God rest their souls.
Quiet!
It is all right, little one. You are safe.
Who was it who attacked your village? Danes?
Don't worry. We will right this wrong.
The Witan is gathered.
Lord God in heaven, grant this Witan the benefit of your divine wisdom as you guide us today.
Amen. Amen.
No one here would deny that Mercia is one of the ancient Saxon kingdoms.
But a kingdom without a ruler is a ship without a steersman.
It drifts with no purpose and breaks on the rocks.
It is, and has ever been, the right of the Witan to decide Mercia's ruler.
Well said! As Aethelred has departed this world... we must choose.
Lord Uhtred has been proposed as Lord and Protector of Mercia.
Mercia has lost many sons repelling the Danes.
Our army is weakened. Our villages wracked with sickness.
We've never been more vulnerable.
To defend our kingdom, we must choose a ruler who will stand shoulder to shoulder with our neighbors in Wessex.
I can assure you, Wessex has no desire to influence this Witan.
Our only wish is that the new Lord maintains the strong bond between our two kingdoms.
Lord Uhtred has not only served Wessex, he also fought valiantly at Tettenhall to defend Mercia.
And let us not forget, he only holds the throne until a younger Ealdorman comes of age and Lady Aelfwynn is old enough to marry.
Does the Witan object?
Then step forward, Lord Uhtred.
Uhtred, Lord and Protector of Mercia, you may take your throne.
Aye, aye, aye! Aye, aye...
Trust your brother's instincts. I invite the Ealdormen to step forward and take their oaths to Lord Uhtred.
I would like to address the Witan.
What is this?
As you know, I have fought side by side with the men of Mercia.
That you accept me as your Lord, it is an honor I will never forget.
And that's what makes what I have to say even more difficult.
However, there is someone better suited to rule Mercia than I.
Someone who cares for Mercia more than themselves, someone who can be an equal ruler alongside our Lord King Edward.
And so, as my first act as Lord of Mercia, I feel I have no choice but to relinquish the throne...
...in favor of Lady Aethelflaed, who's led you to victory when Aethelred abandoned you... who's always put the welfare of Mercia first.
A woman cannot sit on the Mercian throne!
She is the ruler Mercia requires! That is enough!
Silence!
Lady Aethelflaed cannot rule Mercia.
With respect, Lord King, you know that only the Witan can decide who rules Mercia.
That is exactly what concerns me about a woman holding the throne.
Because were she to marry, her husband could become the new Lord of Mercia, bypassing this Witan.
If I may speak, I am devoted to Mercia.
I would never be swayed to act against its interests.
That may be true, but King Edward is correct.
It has always been the preference of the Witan that a woman should not take the throne. Only a preference, not the law.
King Offa's widow ruled Mercia for many years and did it well.
If you allow Lady Aethelflaed to take the throne, you are exposing Mercia to great risk!
Perhaps I have a solution.
If it provides the Witan with the reassurance it requires, I will swear an oath that as long as I am Lady of Mercia, I will remain chaste.
This is not something that I do lightly, but it is a sacrifice I am willing to make for Mercia.
No. This is not acceptable.
I propose the Lady Aethelflaed as ruler of Mercia.
Who supports Lord Uhtred?
Aye!
Aye, aye, aye!
Aye, aye, aye!
Aye, aye, aye!
Aye, aye, aye...
Say it, Lady Aethelflaed, so that we may witness your oath.
I swear... that as long as I hold the Mercian throne, I will remain chaste.
Is the Witan agreed? Agreed!
Agreed!
Then, Lady Aethelflaed, you may take the throne.
Aye, aye, aye!
Aye, aye, aye!
Aye, aye...
Clear the street! Back to your homes!
Move. Hey!
Hide yourself.
Finan, I'm... Stiorra!
Ensure that nobody resists and the gates remain closed.
Guards of Wessex, spread out!
Take up your positions!
Man the gates!
If today were not a celebration of the new Lord of Mercia, I would fear that King Edward's guards were seizing Aegelesburg.
They do not look like they are celebrating.
We need to find Uhtred... and advise him.
Hey, hey!
In the name of the Lord, I wish to be loyal...
Your reign was brief, Lord Uhtred.
I offer myself...
But in that time, you've served Mercia well.
We have the ruler we need.
Yes, you do.
King Edward's guards have taken control of Aegelesburg.
Stay alert on the ramparts!
Take your position on the West Gate!
Pyrlig, what is this?
This is what happens when King Edward feels he's been insulted.
This is Mercia. He has no right.
I suspect he believes his army gives him the right.
Let us not forget that Mercia and Wessex are allies. I would like to speak with my brother.
The King is at prayer and says he does not wish to be disturbed.
Please tell him I wish to see him.
I will relay your message.
Where were the Mercians?
How could Edward seize Aegelesburg without opposition?
The Mercian Guard is leaderless without Eardwulf and the fyrd is disheartened and scattered.
Without an army, how do we respond?
We do nothing until I have had a chance to talk with Edward.
And what if he will not talk to you? Then I will wait.
His men are everywhere. You're not safe here.
Perhaps it would be wiser to move somewhere else.
No. I remain here. Even if that places you in danger?
My first act as Queen cannot be to flee Aegelesburg.
Is that not preferable to being killed? I hope it will not come to that.
So, we just sit here and wait? Or we can eat and wait.
Or later sleep and wait. But we wait.
Because we cannot rush Mercia into conflict with Wessex.
Stay with Aethelflaed. Guard her quarters. No one is to enter without her permission.
What about her brother?
No one. You two, with me.
Where, Lord? To ensure Aethelflaed will not have to rely on Edward's goodwill for her survival.
I'm Eardwulf. Ah, yes.
You're the arse-licker?
I'd heard there were Danes in Wealas and I was coming to talk to you.
I don't talk to Saxons, I kill them. You will change your mind when you hear what I have to say. I have something very valuable that I can share with you, something that will help...
I thought he'd never shut up.
Is it true my father relinquished the throne to Lady Aethelflaed?
It is.
Was that his intention all along?
The only reason he was baptized?
Perhaps I should be angry with him for mocking God.
You know, but I am not.
Your father is a man of strong convictions, as are you.
He is driven by his passions.
But he does not act with bad intent. I know.
And I am grateful to him. He tests my faith, again and again.
And each time, it grows stronger. That pleases me to hear.
But what is also very clear to me now is that I must follow my calling... to serve God and only God.
So, I must go.
Do you think it is wise to bring the child here?
Join us.
What is that you have?
Is it a man? No. It's a king.
Is he a good king?
Yes... like you.
Now that you have taken Aegelesburg, what will you do with it?
Hold it, until Mercia is in the charge of someone I trust.
You can trust Aethelflaed. So, you side with my sister?
I take the side of our family, and perhaps Uhtred has done us a service.
By breaking his word and going against my wishes?
Thanks to Uhtred, our family now sits on the thrones of both Wessex and Mercia.
And your father's dream of a united England is even closer.
Aethelflaed is your blood... and she will be loyal to you if you allow her.
She is not a threat, Edward.
Deheubarth Fortress lies ahead.
It will be well defended, but we have darkness and surprise on our side.
So, move swiftly and attack without mercy.
Yes, Lord King.
Danes. I can smell their stench from here.
Shall we attack or retreat? We are men of Wealas. We attack!
Form a line! Form a line!
Slaughter them! Slaughter them all!
Loose!
Do not be afraid. We will prevail!
Do not stop!
Longbows!
Loose!
Loose!
Retreat! Fall back!
Save yourselves!
fire! Ready bows!
Loose!
Retreat!
Retreat!
Loose!
Finish them!
Good morning. We thought it a shame to waste your fire and food.
Seeing as you won't be needing them. I can help you.
I do not need an arse-licker who will not shut up.
I don't remember you laughing at Tettenhall.
You weren't just defeated there. You were humiliated.
Edward and his army celebrated a great victory.
And they're still celebrating, eating and drinking and telling tales of how the Danes were vanquished. But I can help you put that right.
I know how to defeat Edward.
But if you kill me... then it goes to the grave with me.
All I'm asking is that you listen to what I have to say.
And if it's not of value, then kill me.
I intend to.
Bring Lady Aethelflaed outside. She has to see what's happening.
What?
Your fyrd are here for you, Lady of Mercia.
Now you have enough men to fight your brother.
And what order would you like to give your army?
To remain calm!
I will not sacrifice a single Mercian life unless it is absolutely necessary.
The fyrd will remain outside.
But I have no doubt that Aegelesburg will soon be in Mercian control once again.
Open the gates for Lord Uhtred.
There is no need for them to be closed any longer.
My Lord, open them and you have my word that the fyrd will not enter the town without invitation.
There need be no conflict between us.
Come see what our father has done. You won't believe it.
Where are you going?
To Wessex.
I need time to pray and reflect alone.
Does Father know?
I've made up my mind to go and I know he will try to stop me.
Why do you have to go?
Father Beocca gave his life to save mine.
The only way I can honor his sacrifice is by serving God well.
That is what I am doing. Take me with you.
You wish to go to an abbey? No, to Wessex, where I can do as I wish.
And what is it you wish to do? Anything.
Because anything is better than waiting here, bored, until I'm forced to marry someone I despise.
I wanna live. That's all.
As much as I would like it, I cannot take you with me.
But your time will come, I'm certain of it.
Take care, sister.
You will always be in my thoughts.
I will let the fyrd into the town.
I can see you have the support of the people of Mercia.
Enjoy this moment. It might not always be so.
As ruler, you will have impossible decisions to make.
I know I've made mistakes in some of my choices.
As long as I am Lady of Mercia, you have my support.
I was blind not to see that you are the right person to rule Mercia.
And for that, I am sorry.
Our alliance is enough for me.
I also wish to discuss East Anglia.
It was conquered by Aethelred, but since his death, it has grown lawless.
I propose we send an army there of men from both Wessex and Mercia to maintain control.
Agreed.
A joint army sends a clear message that we are allies.
After that, we can push north into Northumbrian Daneland.
Together, I believe we can achieve our father's dream of a united land.
Pyrlig?
I'm looking for my son.
He is gone, Uhtred. Gone?
Where? Back to his church in Wessex.
When did he leave? He left before dusk.
I suggested he speak to you before leaving, but he refused.
Is this because of the baptism? No.
It is simply that God has called him away.
I know you do not share his beliefs, but trust me... he is a young man you can be proud of.
Will he come back?
I hope so.
I will prepare to return to Coccham.
You will not stay? No.
Staying here and... seeing you every day...
and not being able to be with you, it is too painful.
The price we are paying is great, but it is an oath that I had to make.
I will miss you, Uhtred Ragnarson.
I will always answer Mercia's call with you on the throne.
I know.
It is good to see Aegelesburg back in Mercian hands.
I wish to talk to you about Aethelstan.
Yes, I am grateful that you brought him to me.
I know you care about the boy... but it is impossible for you to take him to Winchester.
There are people there that may wish him ill.
If it is agreeable with you, I would like to take charge of the boy and take him to Bedwyn and raise him there, as I raised you.
To follow your footsteps and those of Alfred's.
Make the arrangements.
I will ask Uhtred to accompany you.
Come play with us.
In a moment. First I must talk to Eadith.
I promised I'd reward you for delivering my message to Lord Uhtred.
Here it is.
Thank you, Lady Aethelflaed.
Aelfwynn enjoys your company and you have been very loyal to her.
I will not forget that.
But I am the Queen now.
You were my husband's mistress and your brother killed Aethelred.
To allow you to remain here would make me look weak.
I do not wish to punish you too harshly. I will arrange a place for you at the nunnery, where you can live and be safe.
I would prefer to find my own way.
May I say goodbye to Aelfwynn? Yes.
Brida, I did not expect to see you.
You have missed a great victory.
Have you seen the wisdom of staying here? No.
I'm even more certain we must attack the Saxons now.
I have made my decision, Brida.
And you will change your mind when you see what I've brought you.
Not unless it is an army of thousands.
Who is this turd?
He is the turd who will help us take Winchester... without a single drop of Danish blood being shed.
I know you think we lost out on wealth and power.
We have something greater than that. Please do not say our friendship.
We need more ale. More ale it is, then.
Royal advisor?
Another jug of your strongest ale.
I will pay for your ale. And when you leave Aegelesburg, you might allow me to travel with you, for safe passage.
Then make it two.
After Tettenhall, Edward believes the Danes no longer hold a threat.
He's taken his army to Aegelesburg, leaving Winchester undefended.
Winchester is King Alfred's spiritual home.
It's a place of great importance to the Saxons.
Only a handful of soldiers remain there, no more than that.
We will never get an opportunity like this again.
Winchester is weak and nobody realizes except us.
You told me you would not ask your men to risk death... unless for food, or land, or to protect their families.
Winchester provides all things and more.
And there is no risk.
We leave for Winchester today.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SEASON: 04
EPISODE: 07
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred.
After the battle at Tettenhall, Brida has been captured and enslaved in Wealas.
Aethelred's death has left Mercia with an empty throne and many vying for influence.
As you know, Lady Aelfwynn is dear to me.
I should like her to be betrothed to a man I trust.
Could you be such a man, Eardwulf?
With Aelfwynn's hand in marriage, Eardwulf was to become ruler of Mercia.
They cast me aside, treat my child as a bag of silver.
But I was compelled to disrupt their plans and took Aelfwynn into hiding.
Find me 12 men to leave immediately.
If Wessex is incapable, we'll find the fugitives ourselves.
Rumors of fever break out in the land...
... bringing fear and desperation.
People are abandoning their villages.
It ravages worse than any Dane invade.
Two of my grandchildren travel on open ground in time of sickness.
Eadith betrayed her brother to protect Lady Aelfwynn.
He murder Lord Aethelred! I witnessed it!
But she has been struck by illness and may not survive.
I fear she's getting worse.
We must return to Aegelesburg, reveal Eardwulf's treachery.
And we tell him what kind of a man he trusted.
A new ruler must be found to bring peace, or all will be lost.
Destiny is all!
In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti...
In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti...
In nomine Patris...
Ignore it. Such disrespect.
I wasn't fond of Aethelred, but he was Lord here.
A curse upon the line of Aethelred!
Quickly!
You will get me executed. You've survived so far.
Can you hide them? She's my daughter. And he's the King's bastard.
What? Do not ask.
It is just until I can get Edward to listen.
I fear we are beyond that. This place is like a tinder waiting for a spark.
Which is why I need you to help me.
Thank you.
Come on, this way.
Curse upon the line of Aethelred!
Is this defiance caused by hunger?
Hunger, fever, a lack of leadership.
How long will the grain last?
That depends on how much the Ealdormen have kept for themselves.
May God forgive you!
Lord Burgred speaks against me yet again.
Ignore the chatter.
Truly dangerous men do not issue threat.
Look at them.
I know that look. You have no plan.
I have a plan.
Shame on you!
We tell the Ealdorman we'll kill their lord.
Forgive me, but there is news.
The Ealdormen have called their Witan for after the funeral.
Why was I not informed?
They say you do not need to know and that you may not enter the Witan.
Pater noster qui es in caelis.
May your name be hallowed.
May your will be done...
What has happened here?
Slaughter, betrayal and now ambition. So, when they come to kill you, what would you like me to do? They will not kill me.
I am the only one who knows where Aelfwynn hides.
We will strike a deal.
The King cannot be trusted.
He calls himself leader of all Saxons, yet he-he schemes against us to make us submissive!
We will ask him to explain himself.
So he can lie about Lady Aelfwynn, as he lied about her mother?
The time has come to take a bolder step! Isolating ourselves from Wessex would serve Mercia no better than King Edward's tyranny!
Then let us put it to the Witan! Who would...
Please, continue.
The Witan is closed to all but Mercians. I am Mercian in blood through my mother.
Lord, no. We must be able to speak freely.
I do not deny that.
Speak. I come merely to listen to your discussions.
You were saying I lied about Lady Aelfwynn?
Everyone knows Eardwulf hunts her on the road.
Yes, to bring her here to safety.
We are waiting until the sickness passes and Eardwulf and Lady Aelfwynn return.
Lies!
That seems an unwise thing to say.
You said we could speak freely and I say this is lies!
Lord Burgred, remember who I am.
You move in your troops, leader of the Mercian Guard disappears, so yet again we cannot defend ourselves.
Then suddenly, from nowhere, a fever closes the city and starves the people! Burgred! You go too far!
You cannot be suggesting I created this situation.
The people are hungry because you hoard the grain!
We hoard it so it cannot fatten Wessex fighters.
Enough! Enough!
The outlaw returns! No outlaw.
Just a man who's seen enough conflict in Mercia. Let me speak.
I am Lord Uhtred, who, with Lady Aethelflaed, has led Mercian fyrds to victory against the Danes at Tettenhall.
I spilled blood for you. I ask that you listen to me in return.
Lord Uhtred, explain to these people Lady Aelfwynn is safe and about to return for her betrothal.
She is safe, but she cannot be betrothed.
Eardwulf has confessed to the murder of Lord Aethelred and he has fled Mercia.
Ignore the heathen! He's just a troublemaker!
Why do you seek to humiliate Mercia with these outrageous lies?
It is no lie. Eardwulf has near confessed it before his men.
This was found on him.
It belonged to Lord Aethelred and was stolen from his dying hand.
Eardwulf has done many things to harm Mercia.
You all chose to turn your eyes from it.
This is the consequence.
What is it?
I'm not going to tell you. Is it wormwood?
It will not work. I've heard it kills men.
Poison can sometimes be a cure.
Mixed with holy water, it will cool the fever.
Look at her. She is dying.
If she does, we will be blamed. There's sickness everywhere, Eadith.
Yes, and who gets accused? Sinners, people like me.
You have not been shunned as I have.
I will not take the risk.
And I thought you were amongst the bravest of warriors.
There.
Now she and I are bothdoomed.
Aelfwynn?
Where is my niece, Uhtred?
We know you traveled the road with children from Saltwic.
Where are they? I will not tell you.
Not until I have your word that Aelfwynn and Lady Aethelflaed will be protected.
You are in no position to bargain!
So, I will ask you this one more time.
Where is my niece?
Tell me or I shall have you seized.
I've done nothing wrong. You know this.
Your actions have caused chaos, disturbed a smooth transition of power and launched an uprising amongst the Ealdormen!
So, even you will understand why I call you traitor.
Take him away.
Find out where he hides her. The girl is our only way to maintain the alliance.
If we cannot betroth her, we lose that bond.
But who to betroth her to?
You said there are no suitable candidates.
Yes.
Perhaps instead of seeking to make a bond with the Ealdormen... we should find a way to break them.
Why haven't we slaughtered them?
We were tricked! You say you have them under control, and then I hear they've taken our villages to the south!
I've never seen men like this before.
I do not want this news to reach my brother whilst he's on holy pilgrimage.
You will tell no one of these defeats. They are terrifying.
What was that?
Huh? Uh...
Are you thirsty?
Stay back! Come on, move aside.
We are taking it to storage, so that Wessex cannot steal it.
Seize the carts!
The King demands the grain be shared fairly amongst the people.
The King does not care for the people.
Mm...
Guards!
Stand aside!
With me!
I would call this provocation.
What is it?
We're being followed. Come on!
Go!
Could we have been discovered?
We cannot outrun them.
We must hide. Hyah! Away!
Lord King!
Why do you continue to impound our grain and occupy our citadel?
May I remind you, this hall is only for the Lord of Mercia and his Ealdormen!
And so I shall remain here until the new Lord is chosen.
Yet the Witan are minded to separate from Wessex.
Really?
You do not speak for the Ealdormen.
You are merely grasping like a greedy child, and I shall not indulge it.
If you want me to leave the hall, one of your men will have to lay hands on a King, a man anointed by God to rule in his name and a son of Alfred.
They dishonor me, you dishonor Mercia for breaking the accord so long held between us.
Who will be the man to do it?
Drag a King through the hall?
Who dares throw himself before God like this?
I will.
I will fight for Mercia.
You forget I am King and wield power like a King.
Lord Burgred... we have taken your son to Wessex for religious instruction.
He will be cared for until his father finds better judgment.
Lady Aethelflaed. Run.
We know you're there! I'll hold them off.
No, no!
Sihtric!
Lady, it's Uhtred's men!
Thank God it's you. My lady.
Aldhelm.
You are not easy to find.
Did Uhtred send you?
What news of my daughter?
She is safe. Uhtred has returned to Aegelesburg to bargain for your protection. Is Aelfwynn with him?
She is being cared for, but... she became unwell.
The sickness? It may not be.
She's traveled a great distance.
Take me to her.
Did the King ask you to do this?
Do not speak.
Were you sworn to Alfred? Where will we have met?
We have fought at Beamfleot.
Must we extract this information from you the hard way?
Can't you just tell us where Lady Aelfwynn is hiding?
It's your choice.
Aelfwynn?
Aelfwynn?
Aelfwynn, please wake up. Aelfwynn...
You've killed her.
No. Perhaps it is the poison burning the fever in her body?
Or perhaps she's dead! No. No, she's still breathing.
We must take her to a place of-of comfort. Let us go back to Aegelesburg.
No, but Lord Uhtred said... I know what Uhtred said.
But Uhtred is not my master and we cannot stay here.
We must get her to a healer in Aegelesburg if she is to stand a chance.
Okay.
Lord have mercy on us.
How are your expressions of piety?
Full-hearted.
Where is Burgred's son?
He is safe.
It was a callous decision, but I suspect a clever one.
It has diminished Burgred and you have averted a fight.
For that, I am grateful.
I do not think the conflict is over.
But you've been decisive, and that will help in times of chaos.
Now you could play peacemaker yourself. How will you proceed?
I will not tell you, for you will not keep it to yourself.
Then I will tell you one thing.
The people of Mercia are Saxon, but they will never be of Wessex.
Force them to be, and they will fight back.
If you do not seek to conquer, all will be resolved.
Continue to care for Mercia, find the right match for my granddaughter, and peace will come.
Did we discover if Uhtred has all the children from Saltwic?
He will not give us that information.
Believe me, we tried to extract it.
Don't turn away from me. This was done in your name.
I did not order this, Uhtred.
Aethelhelm claims he acts for you.
Look at me!
Fetch him food and water and furs to keep him warm.
Yes, Lord.
I did not order this, because I knew it would not work.
Lord Aethelhelm was foolish to think you would weaken.
Tell me, where does it come from, this courage?
You have suffered greatly, and for what? A child you barely know?
Not for her.
Then why?
The same reason I fought at Tettenhall.
My deep love of Mercian politics.
You love my sister.
Your sister is a widow. She has my respect.
I've always envied you for choosing your own path.
Looked at the way men followed you and felt... inspired, if somewhat grudgingly.
And now I wonder if you are as imprisoned as I am... unable to escape a life that was imposed upon you.
Neither of us asked to be here.
For my part, the choices are growing narrower.
I have tried to find a solution here that respects the Mercians and keeps order.
But events have turned against me... and I have to ask myself, does God want me to fight for this?
I have followed the guidance of others too long.
I have made mistakes, yes.
I have lived somewhat in Alfred's shadow.
And now you see the light?
I know he was speaking the truth when he said the kingdoms are stronger united.
So, perhaps I should be unifying them myself... rather than making a child do it for me.
You are free to go, Uhtred.
Return to Aelfwynn.
Reunite with my sister and keep them safe until the conflict passes.
Matters may grow ugly here. It is best they do not see it.
You learn something every day...
They'll be pushed back to the sea, drowning in their own blood!
Picked on the wrong men this time!
Hey!
Did you hear that, bitch?
Do you want to congratulate us?
Oh, she cannot speak for thirst.
Hey, want a drink?
Come on. Come on.
She says your daughter passed into the next life.
And her body was taken to Aegelesburg.
Has Uhtred finally realized the stupidity of his defiance?
I would say not.
But I have asked him to leave Aegelesburg.
And I would like you to do the same. Lord?
More than once you have taken it upon yourself to interpret my wishes in a way that I find unchristian.
I have tried to guide you on a bolder course.
Is it boldness to confine a widow?
beat a man as he was chained?
I simply placed myself between you and some necessary unpleasantness.
I did what you asked. But not what I wanted.
Once again, you used my orders to suit your own wishes.
Perhaps being so far from home has clouded your judgment.
Return to Winchester, and all will be well.
Very well, I shall do as you request.
I hope your mother advises you better than I have.
Wonderful news, Edward! The word is that Aelfwynn has been brought to the gates.
She is here?
Shall I bring her into the town? Yes, of course! Bring her to me!
Open the gate!
See? It is a sign! The Lord did not want you to be a tyrant and now has sent you your reward!
Move, move!
Oh, dear God! We will need a priest.
We've tried everything. She needs the final rites, Lord.
Find me every healer in town. Do not speak a word of this to anyone.
Yes, Lord. Come with me.
Go.
Do you think she will survive?
Dear God!
I'll find the man who did this.
Eh, don't, don't, don't.
What now?
There's nothing for us here, Finan. Where's my daughter?
She's insisting on helping Father Pyrlig and I've tried to dissuade her, but...
She is too stubborn because she is my daughter?
Hm.
Where is she?
The King continues to take the town.
He feeds the people.
Truly, you have lost your judgment.
Think on your son!
There's grain! Come with me.
The cart's here!
Okay, there's plenty to go around. Form a line.
Don't push!
Here.
Stand back and form a line!
You don't need it! Hold on!
You would think the grain was silver.
Hey, calm yourselves. Calm yourselves! There's more than enough.
Stop this! Stand back!
Get off me! Get off!
Stiorra!
Finan, take Stiorra!
Look at me. You're fine. Stop! Drop it!
Enough! Get back!
I know you suffer, but turning on each other will not save you!
You must work as one rather than quarreling amongst yourselves.
Now, get back behind the cart and form a line.
Each person will be given what they need.
Look how he influences them. Trust me.
He will make them rise against you. Mercian must not fight Mercian.
Anyone who wants grain must keep the peace.
Finan, help me with the bags. Lord.
Bring him before me.
Bless you.
Thank you.
kill anyone who looks like they cannot work!
Fat ones we can sell as slaves.
Secure the fort!
Spare him!
You want the silver?
I have no interest in silver.
We are looking for a Dane named Brida.
Too late. I killed her.
You did not!
Lord King, I was leaving as we agreed.
But then you chose to be part of a disturbance in the town.
I did not choose to be part of it.
You were just guided by forces beyond your control?
As ever, Uhtred is but a plaything of his gods.
You wanted to bring peace to Aegelesburg.
Which is better than wanting to start another battle.
You truly think I seek battles?
Perhaps not, but that is what will happen. The Ealdormen will not back down, so you will finish the slaughter that the Danes have started.
I fear you are right.
There is a risk of great slaughter.
Innocent people will suffer.
I will crush them, leave the town in the care of the Wessex Guard.
They will run the place as they feel they need to, which is rarely an easy life for the people, is it?
Strange things happen in times of conflict.
The Ealdormen are passionate that they could repel us for a while.
Whichever way, the conflict would continue.
They might try to hunt down my sister.
They would not find her.
So you will live as fugitives for months, years? Is that how you see it?
I've spent many years on the road.
True, but it is not the life that was meant for Aethelflaed.
Hardly what she deserves. That is a choice you are making.
If I place someone to rule here who might forge a path to peace, someone who might not necessarily please the Ealdormen, but whose popularity with the people might force them to accept it...
Let us call him a Lord and Protector who would rule here just for a few years until things are less volatile.
I wondered if that person should be you.
Me?
I do not want to rule here.
Yes, but as we know, you rarely get to make your own choices.
Find an equilibrium, wait for an Ealdorman to come of age, if my niece survives, betroth her to someone Aethelflaed chooses.
It is clear to me you have the respect of the people here.
They listen to you.
So, perhaps we should use that to our mutual advantage.
I do not seek advantage.
Even to bring peace?
You accept, you ensure Mercia returns to how it was, before Aethelred destroyed everything.
If I do not? As you said, there will be slaughter.
And that will be a choice you are making.
Accept and your reputation will be restored and your men given status and wealth.
And in a few years, you will be free to pursue whichever dreams you may have.
I could give you the troops you need to retake the fortress you lost.
And in return?
I would be your King and expect your loyalty.
I expect an answer by tomorrow.
How do I know you are Brida?
I fought with Guthrum. I followed Ragnar.
I killed men at Tettenhall...
So, you have heard of Saxon battles. That does not make you Brida.
It is Cnut's babe you carry, or that of a Welshman?
The babe was made by Cnut, but Cnut's fallen.
I do not know you.
Cnut's cousin, Sigtryggr of Irland.
Sigtryggr was defeated and killed.
Defeated, yes, driven from his settlements, yes.
But at this moment, quite alive.
And who do you belong to now, Brida? No man. I am a warrior alone.
You do not look like a warrior.
Give me your sword and I will show you.
Give you my sword? You might kill me.
No, the Brida I have heard of is cunning, so I will stay armed.
If you are who you say you are, then show me.
Listen to me. Talk.
Prepare to be broken, as you tried to break me.
Brida! You have the anger of a she-wolf!
Is he joking? No.
So, he's either lost his mind, or he's a genius like his father.
He says that Aethelflaed will be defended. And it is true.
No other leader in Mercia would protect her like I would.
But?
But I was not born to be the Lord of Mercia.
I never sought that kind of power.
Well, perhaps that in itself makes you the best man.
Mercia has suffered from being led by ambition.
So, apart from the silver and the power and saving the woman you love, what is holding you back?
Giving my loyalty to another Saxon king. I swore to myself I would not do that.
I swear I will not drink too much ale and I frequently go back on my word.
Nobody wants to rip the two kingdoms apart, least of all Aethelflaed.
It is a path to peace. And she would be safe.
So, we have no conclusion other than Edward has outwitted you.
For now.
So, he is as clever as his father.
Which will be good for all Saxons, including you.
How did Cnut fall? Was it his arrogance or his anger?
Both, but mainly his betrayal.
So, who did he murder to further his ambition?
He took Ragnar, who I loved, and blamed another.
Mm. The man had a reputation for cunning.
I had always admired that.
But he died dishonored, if he allowed his woman to be enslaved.
That was the work of Uhtred the Dane Slayer.
But I will have my revenge on him.
I have heard of this Dane Slayer and what he has done to our people for years.
Why did Cnut not come when we requested help?
We had our own battles.
What?
You escaped without our help. My kinsfolk did not.
Our women and children were murder by the Irish before we had a chance to save them.
Then you should avenge them and make more children.
Perhaps you're right.
Grow strong here.
Rest the men, get more silver, then retake Dyflin.
It seems empty, no?
Yes, the greatest riches are in Wessex.
Sadly, the Saxons do not like to share.
And yet they say their faith is based on love.
They talk a lot of shit.
More shit than the Irish? This I can't believe.
You have a lot to learn. What are you gonna do for now?
I'll cut off the head of this man and send it to Hywel.
It's just around the next corner.
Where are we going? It's a safer place to hide.
Let's go.
That's it. Go inside.
Go.
Stay there.
Show me that child, Father Pyrlig.
Do not hide him from me.
He is here?
You know about him? Indeed.
I fear he had been taken, or lost forever.
Did Uhtred bring him here?
Apparently, even Aegelesburg is better than the road.
Had quite the adventure by all accounts. Then I thank him for it.
I know you dislike him, but maybe Edward is right this time.
Father Pyrlig, what have I not been told?
There is a rumor you have struck a bargain.
Indeed.
I do not like the man. I do not need your approval.
But it may be the only compromise.
The Ealdormen will complain, but this time, do not treat them too harshly.
Then you will find some redemption.
I do not need redemption, either. Oh, my son, you do.
If only for the sins of your mother.
Who is this? He is Aethelstan.
He cannot be here.
I know it is difficult for you to acknowledge him, but I wondered, now that certain threat are absent... perhaps the moment has come for you to be reconciled.
Mother, I cannot. Please.
He has lived a life of lies, and that must be righted.
I was wrong to wrench you apart, and it's something that I deeply regret.
I thought my past actions were protecting you and Wessex, that I acted in the name of God.
But God put love in your heart, for your first wife and this child.
And I should not have ignored that.
So, I ask for your forgiveness... and his.
He needs your protection.
Place him back to where he was concealed.
My King.
Have you made your choice? I will accept.
If I can rule as my own man.
I've never wanted to control Mercia. Only see it at peace.
Good, then we are of one mind.
At long last, I strike a bargain with Uhtred of Bebbanburg.
That is a name from another life, but yes, for now, we strike a bargain.
Guards!
Cenric, stand down your men.
Lady, I cannot. The King forbids it.
I am told this is where my daughter's body is.
This is where your King has led us.
Cenric, please, in the name of Alfred, open the gates and stand down your men.
Open the gates!
Oh, my dearest girl, you've come home. Aelfwynn is dead.
No, child.
A miracle has occurred and you are mistaken in your heartbreak.
Mama?
 This night together!  Oh, oh! Eh, eh! To Eadith, for not killing the Lady Aelfwynn.
To Eadith! Yes!
Your brother has restored peace, the people are being fed, and the fever passes.
To Sihtric and Aethelflaed and Young Uhtred, too.
May they return safely.
But if there's ale still left when they get here, then we have let ourselves down.
Mostly, everyone now looks forward to the new Lord.
Who is that to be?
He has asked Uhtred.
To the lands, to the silver and to the women!
To Uhtred of Mercia!
Uhtred of Mercia!
Finally, he can pay us some money!
I very much doubt it.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SEASON: 04
EPISODE: 06
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred.
I helped the Saxons defeat the Danes.
Cnut was killed, but I left Brida to a terrible fate.
Send me to Valhalla.
Take the pagan bitch!
Brida!
As Aethelred lay dying, new dangers arose in Aegelesburg.
We will betroth the Lady Aelfwynn to the successor and seal the bond between our lands.
I am concerned about the fate of our daughter.
So, what is it that you want?
At the very least, you agree not to betroth her to some heartless fool.
The king wishes to betroth me to your daughter.
No, I will not agree to it.
Have Aethelflaed confined until this is settled.
She was rescued by an unexpected ally.
Come, I’ve alerted the man that protects you.
He’s outside the window.
And I have pledged to protect Aelfwynn on the dangerous road that lies ahead.
Stiorra, get the children on the cart.
We head north towards Ceaster!
Destiny is all!
Stop crying! I cannot bear it!
Be kind.
She wants her mother.
We survived without a mother.
You must be stronger. Be grateful.
Better this than being wed to an old man.
Do we stop?
No. Edward and his men will be half a day behind us at most.
We must move faster to have any chance.
I bring a message from Lady Aethelflaed.
Did your brother send you?
No, he does not know I am here.
He imprisoned Lady Aethelflaed, but I released her.
Why should I believe you? I do not lie.
How did you find us?
Lady Aethelflaed herself said you spoke of traveling the road to Ceaster.
There’s no one else, Lord.
And you took the road alone? Yes.
And she wants you to meet her at the ruins of St. Milburg's Priory.
St. Milburg is on the road to Wenloca, and we have passed it.
It might be a trick to divert us.
I’ve done what I promised. You can choose to believe it or not.
And where do you go? I do not care!
I have family in Frankia.
That way is inland.
Ships come in near Ceaster.
Travel with us. We will show you.
If she's lying, at least she’s under our control.
I’m sick of being controlled.
Then travel alone.
When did Aethelflaed leave?
Last night, in haste.
Without much silver and only Lord Aldhelm to protect her.
Then she may be at Wenloca already.
We should ride back to meet her.
Lord, we should not do this.
If she found us, so will they.
Are you good with children?
Not really.
Excellent, neither are we.
We go back!
We will seize Uhtred's lands in Coccham and take his children.
He will pay for abducting a child of my blood.
We think his children are with him.
He was seen on the road with a number of children.
Speak of this to no one. We need to maintain a semblance of order.
I fear doubts were already whispered by the Ealdormen.
They want my betrothal agreed.
Then say it is agreed and that I have decided.
With respect, Lord, your decision is not final here.
Lord King, the priests are telling me that the room offered to Aethelflaed to grieve is empty.
It appears she has also left Aegelesburg. She conspired with Uhtred to betray us.
They are saying your sister Eadith was the one who conspired to release her.
Then all these traitors should be dragged back on their knees.
I apologize, Lord, I speak only out of frustration.
Aethelflaed is in grief and does not know herself. Get your men to track them.
Let me take the Mercian Guard... No. Cenric's men will find them.
It is better you stay here and maintain a sense that everything is proceeding as it should be.
They must hurry. The danger of division is real.
Ludeca is appeased for now, but Burgred is stirring up the Ealdormen against the match and against Wessex.
What if the Ealdormen discover Lady Aethelflaed and Aelfwynn are missing?
They will not discover that, because all the fugitives will be found.
I’ve not asked. It's a bit stale.
That bread is so stale, it’ll take a tooth out!
Leave the fresher bread for the children.
My men have the stomachs of dogs.
That’s very true.
In fact, I once ate a dog. I always said you were barking!
You are kinder than your reputation, Lord.
Lady Aethelflaed is lucky you serve her. I do not serve her.
But I owe her my respect.
I never sought to disrespect her, only protect my brother.
And did he protect you in return?
You know the answer to that.
No! No! Father! Lord!
Go back! Stay back! The road is closed!
Let go!
Move! Stop there!
Stay back!
Lord, stay back! It's the sickness. They’re dying of the sickness!
It was a kindness, Lord.
Which hand did he grab?
Leave her be.
Lord, it is spread by touch.
No, it is the air that spreads it. Do you have it?
No! No!
Go!
And the animals, we should kill the horses.
Father, what if I breathed the air?
It will not matter. It only takes sinners.
That’s not true. Your father’s right. It’s in the air.
It could take us, any one of us. We should return to Aegelesburg.
If there's sickness in the land... We cannot go back.
We cannot defend ourselves against Edward's men or Mercian Guards.
Better to die in a fight than choking blood.
We go across land to Wenloca, abandon the path, avoid the bad air.
The children will not make it on foot.
Then we leave them... somewhere safe and then...
I will not leave the children!
But, Lord...
Lord, I have followed you without complaint, but do not inflict this on men who’ve been loyal to you.
Finan, we have no choice. We have to alter the plan.
We'll leave the horses somewhere safe. We’ll go across land to Wenloca on foot.
We’ll be safe from the sickness, trust me.
All right? Hm.
We go to Wenloca! We find Aethelflaed and we get to Ceaster.
Let’s find a place to hide the horses.
Is this St. Milburg's? Yes. Trust the marker.
We should get off the road before nightfall.
No. I will be here when my daughter comes.
Aldhelm, what if Edward's men have taken my child?
What if she is imprisoned somewhere at this very moment, not knowing where I am?
Lady, do not torture yourself.
Uhtred will have rescued her and he will find us.
He has never failed you.
And yet this feels like failure.
A daughter of Alfred riding as an outlaw in her own country!
Your father lived off the land for a while. He survived and prospered after.
In time, we will return to Aegelesburg.
I’m not certain we can.
I fear I may have led you along a path from which there is no return.
Aldhelm, they may spare me, but I... I understand, Lady.
I understand.
It won’t be long.
You must be strong. Think of your brother.
Who allows you into the King's chamber? I do not need permission.
I am merely showing my son where he will rest when he is Lord.
You are a fool to pursue this, Burgred.
It's as though you wish to lose another child.
Why would I be frightened of Edward's puppet... when I have greater forces on my side?
Who?
Who are your forces?
None but the Lord himself.
There is a reason we survived the massacre.
God wants us to right the wrongs done to Mercia.
Nevertheless, I will be betrothed to the child, and I will succeed the throne.
If it is so certain, why is it not yet done?
I think the King conceals something and lies to us.
So, we will wait for our moment.
The crowds are growing. Yes, Commander.
News of Aethelred’s death spreads.
Nervous villagers seeking protection.
There is a matter more pressing. Find me 12 men to leave immediately.
If Wessex is incapable, we’ll find the fugitives ourselves.
This many people on the road, someone must have seen them.
We’ll soon find them, Commander.
Lord Ludeca.
I’ve heard news. There’s sickness. Yes?
It is spreading across Mercia. Thank you. Let’s go.
No word? Not yet.
Could they have gone north, not south? It is possible.
Keep them looking.
We’re running out of time, Lord King. Tempers are fraying.
Father Pyrlig, how do the preparations proceed?
Forgive me, but we should delay all ceremonies.
They say the sickness is coming. People are abandoning their villages.
It ravages worse than any Dane invade.
We have to protect Aegelesburg.
Close the gate!
We cannot abandon the sick!
We risk spreading fever. We must close the gates!
Lord, overrule this.
No, Ludeca is right. More people will provoke trouble.
We have a duty to protect all Saxons.
You cannot close the gates, when the people seek refuge!
We have to protect the town, Burgred.
The other Ealdormen would agree. You know this.
I hope your reward for doing his bidding is worth it.
Perhaps we should keep it open. The people are clearly frightened.
Frightened people frighten others.
Overrule me on this and the Witan will say you seek to conquer us.
Besides, for now, Burgred has no men to fight for him.
Do not provide him with a readymade fyrd.
I agree.
Shut the gates!
Shut the gates!
Close the gates! Get the gates closed!
Where is she?
Where’s Lady Aelswith? And who helped her?
Who betrayed us?
Leave the frogs alone!
Was I wrong to oppose the betrothal?
No.
You are trying to protect her.
Perhaps I should have accepted it all with good grace.
I was married young and I survived.
Lady, your husband wished you dead.
Maybe that’s what royal husbands do.
Maybe that’s what I should have been preparing Aelfwynn for.
Hurry!
For your own safety, don’t stay here!
Do the Danes return?
No. The sickness is taking young and old.
Escape the foul airs while you can.
The sickness has not struck for many years.
Follow us. We go north.
Join them.
No, we’ll miss Aelfwynn.
Lady, do not be foolish. The sickness takes all, regardless of rank.
I would rather be foolish than abandon my child.
Do not ask again.
He’s heavier than he looks.
What’s wrong with you? I have a fever from the grasses.
I do not have it!
Finan, the sickness would not strike this fast.
You’ve not seen what I have, Lord.
Oh, hey! How many times do I have to tell you?
You cannot do that!
Who are you anyway?
I am no one.
He’s Aethelstan, Edward's firstborn son.
Hidden child of Edward! How did he survive this long?
He’s driven by a mission to annoy me, aren't you, Aethelstan?
Better keep him safe, Finan. That’s royal blood you're carrying.
Welcome to the bastard life, boy.
You can smell it on the air. They’re burning bodies.
It means the fever is just fields away.
Lady, no one has passed by for hours.
They’ve probably closed the roads to contain the sickness.
Uhtred will have gone on ahead to Ceaster.
We should do the same.
How much longer? Again and I will not reply.
It is right at the end of this field.
We should be able to see the cross any moment.
We’re looking for warriors traveling with children.
Did these warriors bring the sickness?
The sickness is on this road.
We have no fear of it!
It only takes sinners!
Is that true?
Move, I’m getting out of the bad air!
I’m not risking the sickness.
I will double the reward of every man who chooses to stay!
What are you looking for, Finan? Bodies!
Eh?
Bodies! I know the sickness is close.
Why are you sh1tting yourself?
I’ve seen men as strong as bears at breakfast time... gurgling blood and pus by supper time!
You little runt!
Take Aelfwynn out of the sun. It is not good for her.
I’m sick of mothering her. I’ve done it for months now.
Think of it as training for being a wife.
I will not become a wife... hard work for too little reward.
Lady Aethelflaed is not coming.
Let's go, not wait for the foul air to catch us.
Lord, I promised her I would send you to meet her.
On horseback, she must have been here first.
She would have gone on to Ceaster as agreed. We move.
Hey! Look at Aelfwynn.
Her face is red. She clearly sickens.
She just needs some rest.
We all do.
Go on. Let me talk to him.
Go on.
How long have we been on the road, Lord? Two days?
And no sight of Edward's men.
They do not know the land up here, Lord. Children need their rest.
Worried about your father’s grandchildren, Osferth? Huh?
This is a good place.
We rest here for the night.
You can sleep now.
Have the fugitives been located?
No. Villagers flee in their droves, but none seem to have seen your sister.
What if the sickness has taken her? What if we drove her into danger?
She left by her own choice, Lord King. Did she?
Tell them to burn herbs in the surrounding fields.
Let the smoke drive out the bad air.
Then we have done one good thing at least.
Eardwulf has left Aegelesburg with 12 of our best men.
Why does he travel in time of sickness?
He has gone to protect the Lady Aelfwynn.
He is a man devoted to his betrothed.
He is devoted to himself.
And would risk the bad air only for treasure.
Anyone here could have warned you of that.
Eardwulf has gone to find Aelfwynn? Yes.
You assured me he would do as we requested.
I asked him to remain.
He is a man of action, not a man of politics.
In future, advise me better in whom we place our trust.
Hey! Good morning, Princess.
Anyone who shits liquid will be left behind.
The gates are closed! There’s no entry to Aegelesburg!
Lord Aethelhelm, explain this to me.
The Ealdormen have ordered that the gates be held closed.
There is sickness here.
Speak to my son.
Of course, but I'm sure he'll not want you to be harmed.
In fact, he might wish that you quit Mercia altogether.
Tell him I survived the swamps of Athelney and am unafraid of the sickness.
Lord, we should go.
I shall leave it to you, Ludeca. Are we certain it’s her?
Sir, I saw her for myself.
Why’s she not in Winchester?
Ludeca, why is my mother being held at the gate?
The order applies to high-born and low.
This is the wife of Alfred.
Nonetheless, you agreed we should not risk the sickness being brought into our town.
The King's mother cannot be treated the same as a peasant...
She can, if you are to respect the Witan.
She is Mercian in blood and defied me to send troops to help you.
If she cares for Mercia, she will turn back.
And trudge the roads like a beggar. Unthinkable, explain to him!
Lord, if you make an exception for your mother, you will be seen as overruling Mercian wishes.
Tell them to open the gates.
I cannot speak in the King's name. That would be to over-reach myself.
The Ealdormen are overruled!
Open the gate immediately!
He lets good Mercians suffer whilst his own kin are preferred.
I fear you were right, Burgred.
King Edward seeks to conquer us.
Why are you here?
Has something happened in Winchester, Mother?
Apart from being threat, on your behalf, nothing whatsoever.
I sent no command for you to be imprisoned!
Then how did it happen?
I said you were to be rebuked for raising the Welsh.
The humiliation of it, Edward, to be manhandled by your men.
It was not an order I sent!
Who, then? Who decided to treat me in that way?
I do not know. It is a mistake.
A mistake? Or perhaps the girl lied?
If by the girl you mean the Queen, no. Aelflaed is a gentle soul...
Lord Aethelhelm, then.
He despises me and seeks to have me diminished.
He does not speak in my name without my knowledge.
I think he schemes to his own plan.
Well you, of course, would recognize that.
Enough fighting. Edward.
I simply wish to see Aethelflaed.
She is not here.
She is somewhere in Mercia with Uhtred Ragnarson.
She travels the road in times of fever?
She has chosen to run with him and abandon her life as a widow.
Then Uhtred has compelled her.
It appears not.
Then she’s gone mad with grief. And is this known by the people?
Obviously not. Nor will it be.
But your father will see it.
From above. Alfred will see it and feel despair.
The lady warrior, putting her strength to good use, I see.
To think men died to defeat you.
I wouldn’t give you the satisfaction.
You smell of shit.
Take some rest.
I will watch over you.
Trust me, I’ve learned the skills of a warrior.
You may have the skills, but you do not have the heart of one.
This life isn’t for you. Why do you pretend like it is?
"Honor your mother and father." It is commanded.
You do not have to do this so that father might love you.
I do not.
Besides, I also know how to defend myself.
I’ve spent a lot of time on my own and taught myself many things.
I’m sorry we were torn from each other.
Alfred used us to hurt Father.
Yes, but at least he led us to a Christian path.
You perhaps.
What heathen gave you that? None, I made it myself.
As I say, I taught myself many things.
My blood on this rune is to protect us on our journey.
They’re traveling with young children. They cannot be far away.
Aelfwynn says she feels hot.
Drink this. It’ll cool you.
You did not see me do that.
I will not tell.
I think she is just tired.
His name is Finan, isn't it?
That's him. Irish bastard and the bravest warrior I’ve ever known.
Bar Lord Uhtred himself.
Forgive him for his alarm. He’s seen the fever take people.
I judge very little, for I am in no position to.
Thank you, Osferth.
If you feel any worse, you tell me or Eadith.
I will.
You are true warriors, aren't you?
Mm-hm.
I don’t know about true warriors.
It is strange to spend so much time with men and not be seen as a thing to be used.
Oh.
Well, if you're offended, I can always... I am not offended.
Build the walls of Winchester.
We’ve picked up a trail, Commander.
Try and get some rest now. We leave before sunrise.
Thank you for not killing my brother.
No honor in killing a sleeping man.
If he comes for us, I will not hesitate.
I know.
I have chosen which bed to lie upon.
Why did you not betray us when you could?
Because I would rather sleep on cold earth than in a palace where people see me as a whore.
Do they look down on you from the heavens?
Your gods?
Do they sit in judgement?
No.
They are more fickle than that.
You please them or displease them. You do not always know how.
So, how do you know which path is righteous?
Sometimes...
I think the path of the warrior is my way to Valhalla.
Sometimes I do not know.
Does your god watch over you?
I look for signs that he does.
But I rarely see them.
Brochfael of Gwent has not smiled once.
Envy. Your victory is his loss, brother.
Hm, perhaps.
Perhaps the spoils are a little galling to him.
Oh, Rhodri, you are a turd.
She was a great warrior once.
It is you who are the great warrior, brother.
What will you do now the fight is over?
I’m going on a pilgrimage... and you can rule from the fortress in my absence.
Play king for a while. You deserve it. You fought valiantly.
Come on!
This way.
Come here, bitch!
You see this? It belonged to Cnut himself.
No, it did not... you lying turd.
Oh!
Throw the Danish whore in the pit!
We lost good men because of her.
Have some grace in victory.
We melt this down.
Pay every craftsman in the country to finish the job that that bastard King Offa of Mercia started centuries ago.
A barrier between us and the Saxons!
And, in honor of our delicious friend here, I swear... the Saxon pigs will never set another foot in our beautiful land!
Eat!
Get up, bitch!
No sleeping down there!
You hungry?
Thank you, Father.
Go. Hide. Come on, quickly.
Get down.
Ah.
Shall I turn a blind eye, Father Pyrlig?
They are just frightened. None of them have the sickness.
I need to speak with you, in confidence.
Lady, please...
I do not want to be involved in any more plans to deceive the King.
Except this one.
I am not concerned about Edward.
He seems to have come to his senses, at last.
But why has my daughter taken leave of hers?
You imprisoned your own sister?
It was a temporary measure to keep the town at peace.
And then sent men of violence to hunt her and Aelfwynn down?
No violence has been ordered.
You send an army, you start a battle.
And now your sister is in harm's way.
Not to mention your son... My son is protected in Winchester.
Your secondborn, yes.
Your firstborn, Aethelstan...
I had hidden at Saltwic.
Mother...
I sent him there... Mother!
I sent him there, because threat were made against him.
Do you know if he has been taken by Uhtred?
I believe Uhtred left with children.
So, at best, two of my grandchildren... travel on open ground in time of sickness.
How has it come to this, Edward?
How have you strayed so far?
Forging an alliance with Mercia is everything.
I did not intend to harm any child.
But children should not be dragged into politics, Edward. We know this.
The ones that are... well, we know they rarely survive.
An actual path.
A good sign. Next village we get to, we can get some horses, move more quickly.
Without wind, the sickness cannot have reached this far north.
I fear Lady Aelfwynn may be sickening.
Yes, but we have to keep moving.
Just reassure her. How?
I do not know.
It’s something I myself have failed at.
Keep going.
Not much longer... Horses?
Head over that ridge. Go!
Come, Aelfwynn!
Faster!
Come, Aelfwynn! Quick!
Help the children! Don't look back.
Keep moving. We're not going to outrun them, Father!
They’re getting closer! Keep moving!
Run! Come on!
It’s the sickness! Stay back!
Stay back!
Dear God.
We can swim through.
No. I'd rather face them and die now.
I’m not sweating and sh1tting in three days’ time.
I want to try. I am not ready to die. No, Stiorra!
Give me Lady Aelfwynn and you’ll all be spared.
Stay your weapon.
My men won’t miss next time.
Shield the little ones.
Aelfwynn, come with me.
Or I will kill all of these people.
Then I’ll find your mother and I’ll kill her too.
Save your friends and leave with me.
She will stay where she is.
Aelfwynn, we are betrothed.
Stand firm.
Protect the children with your lives.
When the fighting kicks off, run like hell toward the trees, wee man.
I want it back.
Are you ready, Sister Warrior? She's ready.
Please don’t let them kill my mother!
Seize the child!
No. No, do not do his bidding!
He has betrayed you all!
He murder Lord Aethelred! I witnessed it...
So speaks a traitor of Mercia...
As he lay mortally wounded in his bed...
This is the words of a whore! I will swear to it on the book!
Aethelred refused to allow my brother to marry this poor child.
So, he killed him.
That is the man you serve.
Ask him why Aethelred was late to the fight at Tettenhall?
Because this man lied to you!
Days he delayed telling you your fellow Mercians were dead!
Days you could have had to travel home and save your families!
He killed and buried the messenger that Edward sent alerting us to the trouble.
My men will not be fooled by your lies.
Let the woman speak!
I have proof of his crime!
Look inside the pouch he wears around his neck!
Inside, you will find the ring that he stole from your Lord as he lay dead.
There is no truth to this.
If there is no truth to it, then prove it.
Show your men what’s inside.
Seize Aelfwynn or I will have you executed for treachery.
Do as I say!
Do not threat your own men!
Enough talk.
If she lies... let us see what you bear around your neck.
Now.
It is Lord Aethelred's. It has his seal!
You cannot deny it. Save yourself before these men kill you.
Flee to Frankia, brother!
You’re safe now.
Will he return?
I doubt I will see him alive again.
It is over for us.
Who did this to you?
Danes.
They have landed west of here... from Irland.
They told me to say they are intent on slaughter.
And that yours is the first head they will take.
There will be plenty of time for reading books and playing games before you'll be needing one of these.
Aethelstan?
You ride with Finan.
Keep an eye on him? Hm?
You two go on the road and find Aethelflaed.
Tell her her child is safe for now.
Eadith and Osferth will guard her here until Edward has sworn he will not harm her.
You will tell him what kind of a man he trusted.
So, we fight for peace, Lord... again.
We cannot let them turn on each other.
We do it?
We do it.
I fear she’s getting worse.
Can you keep her alive until I return?
We will do everything we can.
We need to.
She is the future.

SEASON: 04
EPISODE: 05
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred.
A great battle has been won, but the Saxons do not find themselves at peace.
You’ve chosen Mercia over the Kingdom of Alfred.
In Winchester, Lady Aelswith has also worked to her own plan.
You will take a message to the Welsh king.
And a rivalry simmers with the new queen Aelflaed.
Lady Aelswith was seen visiting Edward’s bastard at the monastery.
What business has she showing kindness to a whore and her offspring?
Yet my part is done.
I turned away from Saxon conflict and looked to uniting with my daughter Stiorra.
I want to make a home for my children to return to.
Stiorra thrives.
She's now grown and is at Saltwic with Aelfwynn, Aethelflaed’s daughter, and another child, a mysterious boy.
Who are your family?
I’ve been told not to answer that.
And though I hope the gods will allow peace, I fear ambitions will lead us back to war.
When we return to Aegelesburg, I will publicly castrate you!
But the heat of battle has brought Eardwulf unexpected reward.
Destiny is all!
Open the gate!
Halt!
Make way!
Gently.
Lift him. Careful.
Have no fear. He will recover.
Stop praying for him to die.
We will be blamed for this. Not if we blame him first.
Stiorra!
Open the doors! Perhaps she is sleeping.
Stiorra, wake up. It is your father.
Stay back and name yourselves.
My father calls himself Uhtred of Bebbanburg. Who are you?
Stiorra, it is us. It really is.
Father has defeated the Danes.
I’ve come to take you home.
You’re lucky I didn’t stab you.
The battle was never close. We would not have left you in danger.
There have been rumors of retreating fighters.
We made a plan if we were attacked.
Where’s my daughter? Aelfwynn!
Aelfwynn, your mother is here!
Mother!
I’ve missed you!
Oh, I’ve missed you too!
Aethelstan! You can come out.
Cnut has been sent to hell!
Who’s the boy?
I am no one.
I will explain later.
Father, when do we ride home to Coccham? Tonight?
No, but soon, once the peace is secure.
Please! I’m too old to be stuck here with children!
Stiorra!
Lord Aldhelm approaches from the road.
Lady, Aethelred is injured.
Some are saying fatally.
There’s a rumor he will not last the week.
We must go to him. Tomorrow.
These roads are too dangerous at night... We must speak to him and the Ealdormen.
No plan has been made for the succession.
Lady, the mood amongst the Ealdormen is ugly.
Those who survived the massacre blame Aethelred for deserting them and denounce your brother for not coming to their aid.
Does this anger extend to Aethelflaed?
I don’t know.
We ride at first light. Lady.
Stiorra, take the children and secure yourselves.
Open the door to no one but us.
Why? You said the Danes were defeated?
It is not just the Danes we have to fear. What?
How much longer will I live like a prisoner?
She is young to take on such a burden.
You were betrothed by her age and suffered worse.
They will remain secure until the new threat have passed.
We should not leave the children unprotected any longer.
My men will stay here.
If Aethelred dies, times will be unstable.
An empty throne provokes more trouble than a weak king.
Our traditions are strong. The Ealdormen will choose a wise successor.
And what if that successor seeks to have you removed?
Widows are rarely welcome in times of change.
Look at your mother. Mercia is my home.
Yet you have no formal protection here, no son or father to speak for you.
At best, they will send you to a nunnery and marry your daughter to the highest bidder.
No! Aelfwynn will not suffer because of this.
So leave.
And come to Coccham, where I can protect you both.
Unless you want to live a life of prayer and chastity.
The Ealdormen will not turn on us.
Battle does not always bring reward, Aethelflaed.
This much I have learned.
Why do the Ealdormen circle?
How long have I been sleeping?
Since the day of the battle, Lord.
You fell and injured your head. Did we win?
I remember very little.
We did. We returned from East Anglia and sent the Danes running to the sea.
Who in the name of God advised that we go to East Anglia?
Um...
You did.
Then news came of the invasion and we returned to protect our people.
After hundreds had already been slaughtered.
I remember arriving at the battle... but I...
Am I to recover? I’m assured that you will.
Why do you lie to him when he is certain to die?
I ease him in his time of need.
More like in his time of judgment.
What is this but punishment for greed and ambition?
Burgred. He left us to face the Danes alone.
Took all the defenses we had and for what?
A few miles of marshland barely able to yield a crop?
Burgred.
I will speak for I have nothing else to lose!
My eldest, pulled from my hands, be...
beheaded.
My youngest and my wife beaten.
Men of honor paraded and humiliated, and no one came to help us!
And yet we survived.
I will not honor him.
And nor should you, Burgred, not after all that you’ve suffered.
Suffice to say that I did all I could to persuade him to return sooner... but I failed.
Trust me, the Mercian Guard feel your loss deeply.
Aldhelm, have you spoken with the Ealdormen?
There’s to be a Witan with the survivors.
Perhaps I will address them.
They can thank me for bringing Cnut to the field.
Perhaps you should remain here. You do not want me with you?
Times are feverish. Now is a moment for calm negotiation.
The men who play politics always say that.
And then they come running for my help.
I demand you do not leave the room. We are in love, are we not?
Did he mention my mistake? Does he blame me for our late return?
He has not spoken of you. Good. Perhaps he’s forgotten.
If he has, it will not be for long.
We should leave before his mind repairs. No, we will stay until he dies.
There is an opportunity to regain our influence.
Brother, no... No, listen.
The Mercian Guard are loyal to me, and the Ealdormen are against him.
Groups are forming as the ravens circle.
I could be a peacemaker between them. Brother, this is madness.
We’ve played with fire and found ourselves burnt.
Lady Aethelflaed.
Are you the woman who is healing him? No.
Merely sitting by his side.
My name is Eadith.
I’ve heard your name.
You must be her brother whose late entry into battle helped us prevail.
Our actions were decisive, Lady. If a little delayed.
I'd like to speak to my husband alone. Lady.
I command the Mercian Guard.
I only take orders from Lord Aethelred. Lady.
Lady Aethelflaed.
Are you questioning whether I know the mind of my own husband?
No, of course not. We will withdraw.
Aethelflaed.
I must be dying if you’re here.
I am certain God will restore you to health.
I fear that may not be true.
Priests have prayed over me as though preparing the final rites.
They will not meet my eye.
And nor will you.
Why have you come?
To revel in my suffering?
I am concerned about the fate of our daughter, should you be taken from us.
Without a father to protect her, I wish to ensure she is not further abused.
You have treated her most unkindly. That’s because she is not my daughter.
I may struggle to remember, but that I know.
So, you must also know the people regard her as your daughter.
She is rather fair for a Mercian... And that consequently, they will seek her hand to support their claim to your title.
So, what is it that you want?
At the very least, you agree not to betroth her to some heartless fool.
As you were?
Our union brought us misery, and the people knew it.
It created a crack in Mercia that did not serve it well.
The Ealdormen of marriageable age were all slaughtered... the best of them taken.
There’s a danger dishonorable hands will try to grasp her.
So? So, allow me to choose someone suitable and I promise you, this kingdom will thrive.
I agree. You should approve the match.
If only you were as faithful to me as you are to Mercia.
If you had not treated me with so much cruelty since our wedding night, perhaps things could have been very different between us.
If you fear death, now is the moment to ask for forgiveness.
Who ordained you confessor?
Then let it be between you and your God.
May he weigh you in the balance for all you have done.
Aethelflaed!
I know that I have not always treated you kindly.
For that, I am sorry.
I was younger and more foolish.
And, as for you, I hope that you can find some comfort.
To live without being loved is a torture.
Which is why you acted with so much cruelty?
If I may say, Lord King, I think this is unwise.
Injured or not, Aethelred will be held to account for abandoning Mercia.
I say let them drown in a turmoil of their own making.
Turned out well for us last time, leaving them to it.
Until the enormous battle.
Indeed, Father Pyrlig knows how to win battles.
We won the war.
Now we must help bring about the peace.
Mercia does not need any more instability.
And what about the people of Winchester? Indeed.
Have my mother publicly rebuked for raising King Hywel's army.
She must learn her interference brings a cost.
Cenric! Lord.
Have our men directed here to help rebuild the town.
Lord. The Mercians are proud people.
I doubt they will want our help.
We will not ignore their plight again.
Our Lord will not recover! We should not delay the decision!
We are too few to pass a decision!
We should wait until other Ealdormen have arrived from all parts of Mercia!
That is how it has been done and shall continue!
But the matter is pressing, Ludeca. Yes!
And the next successor is clear.
My younger son's claim is strong through his uncle... and he is untainted by a connection to disloyal Wessex.
Your son is too young, Burgred.
Oh, come on!
If the worst should befall our Kingdom, we will need a man of wisdom!
Oh, wisdom!
And who would you be thinking of, Ludeca?
He may yet be well enough to announce his own successor.
We should speak to them. They talk in circles.
They will not offer me a chance to speak. They can refuse you?
They say I should be at Aethelred's bedside.
Tell me it is less disordered than it looks.
I cannot.
There is division. There is anger. They think Wessex has abandoned them.
And there is talk that they do not honor the union.
As in Mercia break from Wessex?
Some are saying that, yes.
Then we must appease them. I understand their frustrations with my husband, but to sever Saxon unity would hurt us all.
We must remain united.
Lord Aethelred, I heard you were injured.
Yes, I...
Forgive me if I do not get up.
They told me that...
Has your father sent you?
What...
He will be in his shroud before the week is out.
You must act decisively to install someone here before chaos breaks out.
His successor is decided by the Ealdormen.
And who decides what the Ealdormen decide?
I cannot simply march into Mercia and tell them how to conduct their affairs.
I've not been as attentive to them as I should have.
Fortunately, you are already here. So, no marching is required.
Danish survivors have been spotted heading east.
Should we send a band to capture them?
No, all forces must come here to Aegelesburg.
Are those the Ealdormen? Yes.
What do we know of them and their intentions?
Those two reckon they have a chance to take the title.
The gray-haired one, Ludeca, wants the kingdom and hasn't the balls to fight for it.
The other, Burgred, wants it for his son, but no one likes him enough to say yes.
Could this son be betrothed to your niece Lady Aelfwynn?
Bring a successor under your wing with a family connection?
It worked for your father.
A child on the throne will not bring security.
Let us meet with the older Ealdorman Ludeca.
He is likely to be the most reasonable. First, I must speak with my sister.
Lord?
It appears there might be new turbulence.
Tell the Wessex Guards to settle within the walls.
Of course. Oh.
And that command to punish the King's mother, that is an order you yourself could undertake?
Was punishment what the King commanded?
It’s what he wants but cannot order directly.
He feels the Lady Aelswith needs... containing.
Brother, you have heard of my husband's injury?
Yes, I've seen him. Should he die, what are the plans for the succession?
It is not clear. The Ealdormen are much diminished.
There is talk of a break from Wessex.
They wish to abandon the alliance between Wessex and Mercia.
They feel you have abandoned them. That cannot happen.
If Tettenhall has taught us anything, it is that the two kingdoms stand stronger when they are together.
I know... I cannot preside over the breaking of our alliance and I will not allow the fracturing of our father's dream!
We will betroth the Lady Aelfwynn to the successor and seal the bond between our lands.
In return for the strength she’ll bring to their claim in Mercia, we will ask they are loyal to Wessex.
I agree with the idea, but it is not that simple.
The best of the young Ealdormen have been slaughtered.
There's no one suitable.
Then we will find someone suitable.
Lord King, the men who remain are not well disposed to you.
There’s no obvious choice. Where is the Lady Aelfwynn now?
Safe at Saltwic with my men.
Bring her here and we will settle the matter.
No! We will settle the matter and then we will bring her here.
Aegelesburg is volatile.
Surely it is best if she is with her family.
She's too young to be used as bait.
Find me the right suitor and we will make haste to arrange a match.
I promise you, brother, this alliance means as much to me as it does to you.
Bring the Ealdormen to me.
Have no fear, I will resolve this.
Keep an eye on the Ealdormen yourself.
I will find out how long Edward intends to stay.
My brother is finally trying to enact my father's will. We should welcome this.
I know, but his authority is under threat and men under threat do not always act with wisdom.
Show respect for the fallen of Tettenhall!
Your sacrifice will not be forgotten.
You must pay your respects, Aelfweard. Come with me.
He is too young to be displayed before the people.
If he's to send men to war, as the future king of Wessex, he must know the consequences.
I will not try and woo King Edward!
I’m not asking you to hump him, merely ingratiate yourself, as will I.
Why would we try a plan that has failed before?
Has it failed? We’re in the palace, are we not?
By luck, nothing more.
You’re giving up too easily. And you are living a fantasy.
Take this opportunity and escape.
Go back to having nothing?
And avoid the turmoil that will unfold when Aethelred dies.
I am mistress to a dead king. You are the favorite of a dead king.
Since when have such people thrived?
Edward is not foolish like Aethelred.
Please, brother, see what is real and what is not.
For a whore, you lack ambition.
What did you say? Every plan we’ve made, you’ve agreed to.
You cannot choose to play and then run, when it gets a little dangerous.
Aethelflaed.
Edward has ordered all his troops to Aegelesburg.
He is just being cautious.
Or he’s expecting a fight.
There will be no fight, because we will find a resolution.
Trust him. He knows now not to put one kingdom before the other.
I am going to Frankia before your insanity drowns us both!
You will go nowhere without my permission!
Is all well, Lady?
Yes.
He is my brother and it is just a foolish disagreement.
My husband is asking for you.
Attend to him, please.
What kind of a man treats his sister this way?
Aethelred has soured this place.
Then leave.
You do not have to do this.
If we went with you, they would follow and drag us back in shame.
Then we go further than they can follow.
North, to the edge of the Danelaw. Ceaster.
The road to Ceaster is too dangerous.
But if we made it, it has Roman walls.
It can be defended.
I want to, Uhtred...
to live in peace by your side... to raise my daughter in safety.
Nothing would bring me greater happiness.
But if we left, we could never return.
We cannot let them destroy all we have fought for.
This is a generous gesture, Lord King.
I know I speak for the people of Mercia when I say we are grateful for your men’s labor.
Come on, men! Let our friends from Wessex see our strength!
Ladies of Wessex, don't pout.
Is this intended as a slight?
Oh, no, Lord King.
He merely strives to redeem his family name and I, for one, look on it kindly.
His father lost his lands in very undignified circumstances.
He merely has the drive of one tainted by disgrace.
Eardwulf?
I believe you pulled me to safety during the battle.
Yes, Lord King, I did, something I’d do for any warrior.
Tell me, how are the Mercian Guard minded on the succession should your Lord depart this life?
We have no view on it.
They’re loyal to the leader of Mercia, whoever that is.
They have little time for politics, but...
They’re good men who respond to strong leadership.
Well, I thank you for your honesty and your action on the battlefield.
Lord King!
On behalf of my people, I demand that you remove your troops from Aegelesburg.
I will not abandon Mercia, when she is in need.
It’s clearly a provocative show of strength!
I know that you are a man in grief, but may I suggest you remove yourself from the King's presence?
Gladly.
I’ve had my fill of Wessex.
There are ways to make men Lord of Mercia without the Witan.
You seek to control us...
and I will use them.
I fear these are not vacant threat.
Burgred will do something foolish to place his son on the throne.
Has he not lost one child already?
Aethelred is fading, Lord.
Time is pressing.
What do you make of Ludeca? He cares deeply for peace, which is good.
But he also cares deeply for Mercia, which may lead us into conflict in time.
He seems a man of piety and reason.
But how old will he be when Aelfwynn is of age to produce an heir?
He is not much older than I am and I am still active in the field.
Aethelflaed will not like it.
With respect, your sister needs to start doing as she’s told.
That man Eardwulf, he seems respected by his warriors.
He is younger and we know him to be brave.
But he’s not an Ealdorman.
Find out what you can about him.
Do not ask me!
What is Edward planning?
I do not know, and I’ve had enough of politics!
You got in trouble for raising the Welsh? You did what was needed.
Did I? Hundreds dead, Mercia in turmoil!
It turned the tide against the Danes. And led to new chaos and new divisions!
Look how the people turn on each other. This is what happens when kings weaken.
The lines of command are broken and the people on the streets suffer.
Nonetheless, I need you to find out what Edward is planning to do with his troops.
No. I’m a man who speaks the truth, or at my worst, a man who uses his fists.
I was not built for spying and betrayal!
I’ll leave you.
Beocca warned me.
He said I might have to choose between my conscience and my King.
But what if it was a message to be steadfast that I ignored, seeking my own glory?
Beocca saw things... more clearly than the rest of us.
He knew what was coming.
And he knew that you would choose wisely.
Where are you taking these women?
On a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Wite.
We will give thanks for our great victory.
You shall not leave the town. An order has come from Aegelesburg.
You are to be confined as a punishment for raising an army without the King's consent.
And when was this confinement decided?
I've been asked to enact the will of the King.
Have Lady Aelswith guarded in the Reading Room.
Do as Cenric orders!
Ignore this girl!
She speaks without authority.
Look how she trembles! Do you defy the will of the King?
You are not the King.
No, but I am anointed Queen.
And in Edward's absence, my will takes precedence.
I will not fight against it.
I simply ask that a soldier bring a prayer book to my room, so that I may reflect.
It will be resolved with a little will on all sides.
Some wine...
He is honest and good-natured, but I am troubled by his age.
Should I offer Ludeca my niece... as a dowry in return for a renewal of the alliance?
That is, of course, your decision, but I would follow your instincts.
Look to the hero of the battle.
No more trouble in the taverns, I hope.
We will send men to water down the ale, Lord King.
Lord Aethelhelm asked me to join you at the table.
I did indeed, welcome.
Continue.
The Mercian Guard is loyal to him.
It would bring the fighting force under your command.
As you know, he’s keen to restore his name and he served Aethelred with complete loyalty.
They even called him The Arse-licker.
I do not want an arse-licker.
I want a man who will serve all of our interests.
Yes, someone who will work with us to achieve the peace you need.
But the choice is yours.
Is there more trouble in the town?
Does Burgred gather men?
No.
No, the King just asked I sit beside you.
It’s a sign that he wishes to propose to the Ealdormen and the Mercian Guard that I should be the successor.
Do I have your loyalty?
The Guard are loyal to the leader of Mercia.
Good.
Then finally order will be restored.
Thank you for staying by my side.
Your wife has commanded it.
They all wish me dead, do they not?
Why? Did I do something to offend my people?
All of you, leave me alone... with...
with Eadith.
I remembered your name.
Were we in love?
Though I know I regret to see you suffer...
I could not in truth say that I loved you.
If I mistreated you, then I am sorry.
Women are used to being mistreated.
We are taught to endure it.
Will you survive without me?
I do not know.
I have survived a great deal.
Tell me the truth. Am I to die?
Prayers are being said for you, yes.
The rumor is that your mind fails and you will die, Lord.
Then I need a miracle.
And it’s not clear that I am owed one.
You could try praying on the relics of our beloved Saint.
For all your mistakes in Mercia, gathering his bones was not one of them.
They’re in the treasury. Ask for them to be brought to me.
I will fetch them.
Perhaps they will bring you to yourself.
Or just a scrap of luck.
I fear that I have much to account for.
This reminds me of when I drank with your father last.
He had just secured victory at the battle of Ethandun.
The feasting was magnificent.
My father always felt our two lands thrived when we broke bread together.
Exactly, the unity between us is critical, both countries, side by side, equal like brothers.
But with deference to King Edward.
With mutual respect, yes.
We should discuss this unity.
And the betrothal of my niece.
It seems wise to secure one with the other... subject, of course, to the approval of the Ealdormen.
The Ealdormen will do my bidding. I have them under my control.
Hm.
Well, as you know, Lady Aelfwynn is dear to me.
I should like her to be betrothed to a man I trust.
I agree that seems preferable. Her youth means that she could be fertile for years.
Yes.
Well, obviously, we want a man with standing in all parts of Mercia, someone we might see as a...
I think the phrase you’re searching for is peacemaker.
Someone who can unite the divisions in Mercia.
Indeed.
A peacemaker for times of peace.
Could you be such a man, Eardwulf?
Eardwulf is not an Ealdorman.
His family was disgraced.
Well, disgrace can be reversed by royal decree.
If you agree, all we would need would be the approval of a Witan.
And the Ealdormen will do your bidding, will they not?
Unless they feel that I am being cheated.
But you would not be.
Because if Eardwulf takes the title, the land he is owed becomes vacant.
And those could be handed to you in exchange for your generous support.
To the peacemaker.
Peacemaker.
To the peacemaker.
Lord, I come with news that will revive you.
Has a successor been chosen?
The King wishes to betroth me to your daughter.
No.
I will not agree to it.
But her hand with mine will unite the two kingdoms and I will be the peacemaker who saves Mercia.
I promised my wife I would not act without her.
Without a plan, King Edward will take your throne and Mercia will be subsumed.
Please, Lord, just trust that I have Mercia's best interests at heart.
I’m begging you. Have I not always served you well?
No.
No, you do not.
I cannot place it, but my stomach tells me that you lie.
Lord...
I have never lied to you.
You have a stench about you.
You are not worthy of my daughter.
You will never rule Mercia.
Get out.
Leave me.
Guards, help!
Help...
Hel...
You did not hear it from me. I merely left the feast to take a piss.
And if I am asked, I will deny it.
Of course, Pyrlig, I will not mention your name, but enough talking in corners, I’ll simply confront him with it...
Edward, tell me there is a mistake that you have not broken our agreement and betrothed my daughter without my knowledge.
We are simply making plans should the worst happen.
You agreed Aelfwynn should not be used as a bargaining piece.
That was before King Edward struck a bargain.
Ludeca, you cannot be joined to Aelfwynn. She’s a child.
I’m not the suitor. I’m merely someone trying to prevent chaos.
So, who have you betrothed my daughter to?
Edward, you swore you'd not betroth her to a man I despised.
He is a great warrior. He is a leader of men.
Aethelred still rules here, and he will not allow this.
I cannot wake him.
I had looked to this moment for many years.
And now it is here, why do I feel as if I want to cry?
I think he regretted the pain he caused you, Lady.
Lord have mercy on his soul and on us all.
Prepare the body and inform your brother that his betrothal will take place imminently.
You are to be sister to the new Lord of Mercia.
Edward, I will fight this! You will not.
You agreed that Aelfwynn's betrothal was best for Mercia...
I will not have my child condemned to a life of misery.
Please, Ludeca, do not accept this plan. The plan offers stab.
I believe it to be the best solution.
Eardwulf is not the man to bring peace. Please.
Lady, begging is unbecoming.
After everything I have done for Mercia... to have risked my life for this reward, my child thrown to a man who will mistreat her?
Perhaps it will teach her more deference than her mother has.
Ride to Saltwic. Fetch the Lady Aelfwynn.
King Edward would like you to ensure no force is used.
He is gone.
Aethelred is dead.
Then you are free.
He can torment you no longer.
I wish that were true.
But they seem to be set on destroying me and all that matters.
I thought Aethelred’s death would be a chance for me to live in peace... after all this time.
But they cast me aside... treat my child as a bag of silver.
I will bargain a way out of this... somehow I will.
We do not need negotiation. We must alert our allies, rally them against Eardwulf, if necessary.
It would set the Mercian Fyrd against the Wessex army. It would be a civil war.
A group of riders have just been sent by Lord Aethelhelm to Saltwic.
They are to take Aelfwynn.
Edward is not himself.
I will speak with him again.
Go to Ceaster. Take her somewhere you can protect her.
Lord, I’ve heard the terrible news. I will inform the people of the tragedy.
Our traditions will unite us in grief.
May it bring a time of healing for Mercia.
I fear my sister will not mourn him.
With respect, Lord King, your sister should follow the custom.
She loves Mercia, but she never loved its leader.
Have Aethelflaed confined until all this is settled.
If only to save her offending the Ealdormen by her lack of grief.
I do not wish to be confined. It’s a chance to mourn.
May I suggest you make this simple and comply?
Lady Aelswith...
Good, a man I trust.
Follow my next instructions... and I am sure you will be well rewarded.
Dip-dip.
Was Bebbanburg as impressive as we were told as children?
It was more so... and harder to attack.
Do you think we’ll ever return to it, or is it lost forever?
I don’t think I will see it again in my lifetime.
Perhaps our children will reclaim it.
I do not want children.
I’m tired of their company.
Aelfwynn, come in... now!
Aethelstan...
Men are riding this way.
Which men? I don’t know, but they’re coming.
Wait!
We have a plan.
Oh? Can I help you? Are you lost?
We’re taking Lady Aelfwynn to Aegelesburg.
She’s already been taken to Winchester.
Who by?
Erm, I think he called himself Uhtred.
Let us in!
You two, search the grounds.
The rest of you with me.
Nothing here.
Off!
I told you... she’s not here.
Let’s go!
Stiorra!
Stiorra?
Stiorra! It is your father!
Did they hurt you? No, it worked.
I sent them away. Good.
Sihtric!
I told you.
We prepared ourselves for an invasion. Lord!
Is it over?
Hey, little trickster you got here.
Where’s Aelfwynn?
Death came for mother faster than she could ever know.
I’ve always felt it would come for me, at speed, from nowhere.
When I saw the horses, Father, I was prepared, but I wasn’t afraid.
Besides, I had faith you’d come for me. And I was right.
Bread, water and weapon, the rest we’ll find on the road.
Stiorra, get the children on the cart!
We head north towards Ceaster.
Do you think we have enough?
With children and a band of five?
It’s only until Aethelflaed secures agreement from her brother.
All will be made right.
Come. I have alerted the man who protects you. He’s outside the window.
If you think I will fall into a trap, you are mistaken.
Please, Lady, I am trying to help you. Why would a mistress help a wife?
Because Mercia has wronged us both and our brothers have turned on us.
Lady, we are not so different.
I have never humped a man for influence.
Just for your country and political alliance.
I never humped Aethelred willingly and, believe me, I am paying for it. Go.
I have nothing and no one. You have silver and men that will help you.
Use them.
Lady.
Will Eardwulf not kill you for this? He will try but he will not succeed.
Go, Lady.
My brother cannot be controlled and will bring nothing but disaster.
Find Uhtred on the road to Ceaster.
Tell him to meet me at the ruins of Saint Milburg's Priory.
Do this and I will ensure you never go penniless.
Aldhelm, do I really abandon Mercia after everything?
Lady, Mercia has abandoned you.
Go.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SEASON: 04
EPISODE: 04
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred.
My lifelong ambition to take back my birthright to Bebbanburg has ended in failure.
Beocca!
He is with God now. He is at peace.
While I struggle to come to terms with this devastating loss, Haesten has revealed the true cause of Ragnar’s death.
Let me live and I'll tell you who gave the command.
Speak. Cnut.
But Brida knows nothing of Cnut’s treachery... and prepares to ride into battle with him.
When the kings are dead, we will sit together on Alfred’s throne.
Aethelred, blinded by lust and power, has foolishly invade Daneland.
Cnut did not sail to Irland. Haesten gave me false information.
You must tell Aethelred the truth! If I tell him the truth, he will kill me.
I will do all I can to soften the blow.
Aethelhelm’s influence on Edward has caused conflict in Winchester.
These are my people.
I will not send them to be slaughtered while Cnut sets the terms of the battle!
You will take a message to the Welsh King.
Aethelflaed is expecting an army. We must deliver one.
I have taken Cnut’s sons as my prisoners and brought them to Aethelflaed... to be used as bait in the battle I know is to come.
Destiny is all!
The monastery is two miles south.
I am not looking for the monastery.
Saxons are not welcome here, Father. I know.
But I’ve urgent business with King Hywel.
Are you Saxon? Well, I was born a Briton.
You will only find trouble here, Brother.
You will find more than trouble if you do not let me pass.
Oh, Lord, grant us the knowledge of your power when it comes to pass that a man and wife may bring a child into this world.
They clothe him. They cherish him, but God alone may know his fate.
These children were in darkness.
Now they are saved.
Bring them the light of your love, Lord God... and let them walk as children of light.
Where are they? Why is she not ready?
They mourn the dead.
...than he who considers before his soul’s departure how worthy he may be deemed after his death...
There is no time for this.
They are children, Uhtred.
Sons of Mercia's most revered men.
When did children become the cost of war?
You did all that you could.
Now, come.
They took their heads. All of them.
We must move off before the Danes know that you are here.
Not until they have been blessed!
Aethelflaed, please... Not until they have been blessed!
Danes! The Danes are here, Lord!
They're heading towards the gates! How many?
Too many, Lord!
Stay back, Aethelflaed.
Seeing you will inflame them. Go! Upstairs now!
They got past the entrance! Go. We will hold them off.
Give me the Lady and you will not be slaughtered!
Do not even consider it!
I will not have men murder in my place! I will not see you taken!
You have the word of Cnut! He only wants Alfred's daughter!
Is there another way out? No!
Can we get to the roof? We would only get trapped.
Let me bargain. Lady, you are the bargain.
We cannot just let death come to us. I will not just wait for it.
What are we doing, Lord? The door will not hold!
Bring me Cnut's sons. Sihtric!
Uhtred, you cannot. There will be another way.
You must trust me and you must swear to me you will stay here. Swear to me! Do not do this...
Where is she?
kill them all!
Enough!
Come and face me.
I have Cnut's sons.
You are lying.
Leave this place or I will cut their throats!
Take a son of Cnut... every Dane in this land will see it avenged!
Yes and every Dane will come for you, too.
The blood of his child will be on your hands.
Do not play games.
Send them down now... or all the men here will be killed.
Leave this place or I will cut off their heads!
You harm them and every Saxon here dies!
No!
No!
No!
No!
Leave!
Or I will kill the other one also!
Go!
Now... go!
No!
Stay down. Look! Your brother’s alive.
Cnut will hunt us as soon as he gets word I killed his boy.
Surely we just show that they are alive? Danes do not work like that.
We're now headed for battle.
What about the boys?
Cut them free and let them run. They’ve served their purpose.
And was the purpose to enrage a Danish army?
It bought us time and allowed us to escape with our lives.
Fate wants to drag us to fight for the Saxons.
Yes. It was definitely fate that dragged us into all of this.
Uhtred had nothing to do with it.
I do not seek battles. Battles just seem to seek me.
But you are right, I have unleashed a storm.
Cnut will find us. This is now our fight.
It was our fight from the moment you took those boys from Haesten, Lord.
The men would be forgiven for abandoning me.
They like an adventure and they’re loyal to a good leader.
As are you.
Which is the fastest road to Tettenhall?
Do not fear the beast. He’s been fed.
Does he like strangers? Only when cooked.
You are from the boy king in Wessex? Why do you come crawling before us?
Wessex would like to strike a bargain.
I do not make treaties with Saxons.
Nevertheless, we have an offer.
There is concern in Wessex about Cnut and his incursion into Mercia.
Alfred's actions have bitten Edward on the arse. So?
Cnut's army is slaughtering all in their path.
You are not friends to us, Father Pyrlig. Why should any of this concern me?
Because it brings a dangerous heathen to your border.
And yet, our borders are strong... because we’ve been repelling Saxons for years.
As you know, Alfred wanted all the Christian kingdoms to unite.
Yes, under his banner, so we could all bow to him.
He wanted to conquer, not unite the faith.
Nevertheless that faith is now under threat.
We follow the same one God and share a common enemy.
You know that, Lord King. And you know to repel Cnut now will save you bloodshed later, so, it is a bargain that works for both of us.
What are Edward's plans?
Mercians are gathering at Tettenhall.
There are... plans for Wessex to join them.
And what would I get in return, in this holy war against the pagans?
And do not tell me recompense in heaven.
Celestial rewards do not build fortresses.
What is it you want?
The spoils of battle, all of them, every last piece of Danish silver.
That is not a promise I have the authority to make.
You are here on Edward's orders, you must have his authority.
Do I have your promise, Father Pyrlig?
Let him swear upon the book.
Eardwulf!
What news of our troops in Lindcylne?
The settlements that surround it are resisting, Lord, but we will prevail.
I should hope so.
I want all of East Anglia or our bargain does not hold.
It would be a shame for your family to go unrewarded.
After so much effort!
He’s like a pig rolling in shit.
Ask me nothing of the detail. It was a favor to you, not to him.
It is enough that humping me has lifted his spirits.
So, you must tell him the news from Mercia.
Perhaps I should delay... You cannot put it off.
I know you are afraid, but I have bought us some goodwill.
I'm not afraid. I'm just... You are afraid and so am I.
But I have done my part, brother. Now you do yours.
Do not let me win, Steapa. Lord, I am not.
What has happened?
The settlements around Lindcylne have capitulated.
If you want to see some hands, it can be arranged.
And what’s the bad news?
You are clearly waiting to deliver bad news.
News has come from Edward, Lord King.
I regret to tell you that Cnut's armies have raided Mercia and taken your palace at Aegelesburg.
Is this the same Cnut that you told me was heading to Irland... to help some feral cousin?
Yes, Lord.
Because of whom I left my kingdom undefended?
And now it is in ruins?
There was no reason to mistrust the information.
My spy in the Danish camp was certain. He swore it was true.
Haesten is a close ally of... Did you say Haesten?
Yes, Lord. He's a close... I know who he is!
He is well known to be a liar!
You are nothing but a rat's turd, who should never have been trusted with anything more than an ax!
I pitied you... gave your whore of a sister the chance to restore your family and this... is how you repay me.
Only a fool would have trusted Haesten.
I know, but I've made a plan to retake... My reputation will be ripped to shreds!
We’ve had word from Lady Aethelflaed.
She will be at Tettenhall, where she plans to lure Cnut.
So now my wife is heading to battle before me... so that she can be revered as the savior of my kingdom?
How in the name of God is that supposed to cheer me?
I'm just saying that there is a plan.
Lord, there is advantage in this, if you play it right, a chance to return to Mercia as the avenging hero.
Can the men get here by morning?
Uh, yes, Lord. I can send orders for them to return immediately.
This could be your greatest triumph... You are finished, Eardwulf!
Please do not execute me.
You will pray for execution.
When we return to Aegelesburg, I will publicly castrate you.
And your family will never prosper and your sister will never leave my bed.
Why have you sent Father Pyrlig to Wealas?
Do not lie to me, Mother. We have spies in every court from here to Rome!
Hywel has Danes, rampaging near his borders.
It is only right for Pyrlig to alert him to it.
Have you asked Hywel for help?
That is unforgiveable.
I had to do something!
Your sister has thrown herself into the lion's mouth.
I challenge any mother to act differently.
You are not just any mother. You are the mother of a king.
Cnut wants us to march on his terms. It is a trap you have walked into.
But Hywel is a Christian, and God wants us to be united.
Hywel serves no one but his own people.
In going to him, you have made Wessex look divided.
Cnut will hear of it and think we are weak!
Yes, but I want my daughter safe.
Then you should have persuaded her to stay in Wessex.
My men would not forgive me for chasing my sister into a hopeless battle.
And yet you know they'll also revile you for letting her die.
Like it or not, Aethelflaed has forced your hand.
So I trade the life of Wessex soldiers for my own honor?
That is what soldiers are there for, to do the King's bidding...
Yes, but not the bidding of the King's mother.
Besides, it is too late. Aethelflaed's fyrds are marching.
You had word of that and did not tell me?
You were elsewhere, making other plans.
If you wanted men to speak your name in awe, believe me, this was not the way.
Lord.
I want all of these defenses finished by sunset.
Yes, My Lord. Good.
We are so close, Brida... to everything we ever wanted.
Lands for our people to settle in for generations.
Cnut?
Yes.
There’s something... Ah. It’s Bjorgulf, returning with Alfred's little bitch.
Where is Aethelflaed?
She escaped.
How did this happen?
Tell us.
Uhtred Ragnarson is in Aegelesburg.
He had your sons with him.
Haesten appears to have traded them for his life.
Tell me that my sons live.
I will not harm you. Just tell me the news.
Uhtred beheaded your eldest son.
He would have killed Esgar had we not left.
No! Why? Why?
I want Uhtred Ragnarson taken immediately!
No. No one sleeps until he is found!
No! This will be paid for in blood, but we cannot let it distract us.
Avenging my child is not a distraction!
Jackdaw!
Cnut, I share your grief and your anger. The gods know I do.
Please... do not let Uhtred lure you into a fight. He's not the priority.
He killed my firstborn And Esgar is still with him!
If I have no heir, all of this... Cnut.
All of this is for nothing! Cnut.
Do not give up our battle position!
It does not matter where we fight! We have a thousand warriors!
Jackdaw! Prepare the men to march! I will.
And send men ahead to find them! We will follow... now!
Cnut... Leave me!
This way is foolishness, Cnut!
You find him, Jackdaw!
You got a numb arse there?
You get used to a numb arse kneeling through church all day.
It’s a damp arse that kills you.
What do you think will happen when we face the Danes?
A numb arse will be the least of our problems.
We're good fighters. When we are all fit to fight.
I have fought alongside your father for a while now.
And he tends to come up with something... at the last minute.
And many men are loyal to Aethelflaed, even at their own cost.
And no doubt the pair of them are devising a battle plan to save us all.
Not here. Not with them so close.
You would deny yourself the day before a fight?
It gives me strength.
What if you die on the battlefield?
I will not die, because God favors those with goodness in their hearts.
Maybe.
I believe the gods play with us.
And we do not know their reasons or what is destined for us.
But tonight, I will believe what you believe.
I thought your destiny was Bebbanburg.
I thought that.
For so long.
But now I ask myself why I failed there.
I know there is a plan for me, yet I do not know what it is.
Only that it leads me to you.
And Finan is right. I chose to be here, so, that must mean something.
It means that you care for the fate of Mercia and the Saxons.
Now you sound like your father.
He only used me for his own wishes.
Yes, he was a wise man, and I tried to follow in his path.
So, perhaps then, I, too, should only use you for my wishes.
Edward... come and rest.
God is guiding you. I know it.
Do not turn away from all of your family.
I know your son would like to see you.
He often speaks fondly of you.
A child without its father's guidance will grow weak.
Which is why I endeavor to seek the Lord's help.
So if you would leave me in peace.
There's no point disturbing him. He is still deep in prayer.
He does not need divine guidance.
He just needs to listen to those of us that know the cost of battle.
His mother’s been advising him.
Yes. I’m afraid that’s not all she’s been doing.
Lady Aelswith was seen visiting Edward's bastard at the monastery.
I am told she arranged a reunion between the boy and his mother.
Why? What business has she showing kindness to a whore and her offspring?
I do not know.
But a rumor persists that their marriage was legitimate.
A false rumor.
But still one that could endanger my son, when the time comes.
I trust you are keeping your husband satisfied.
Another son would strengthen our position.
I try to, Father, but he is not as attentive as he once was.
The matters of Kingship weigh heavy on him.
Then you must try harder... because it is clear that Lady Aelswith is following a plan of her own.
Then you must do something to stop her, before she turns the King from me and my son!
I will do what I must. Trust me.
I have not come this far to be thwarted by a bitter widow.
Um...
Is this the place?
Yes.
I'm not sure I can see Edward's camp.
I’m not sure I can see anyone.
He will be here.
I sent word that the fyrds should gather in the woods.
I will ready them for battle before my brother arrives.
Lord.
Men!
That is not a fyrd. And they are not Mercian.
You do not look like Christians.
We are men from Wealas, loyal to King Hywel.
Are you an ally or an enemy of Mercia?
We are here to fight Cnut, Lady.
And best The Dane as we have bested the Saxon for so many years.
And the fyrds?
I put them under the command of the little bald priest.
I am not bald! I'm certainly not little!
Father Pyrlig! I do not understand?
He rode to Wealas to beg King Hywel for his army.
Edward sent him to find allies. I knew he would not abandon me!
No, Lady. It was your mother who sent me.
I have had no word from the King.
Then we fight with what we have.
It’s good to see you, Pyrlig. You, too, Lord Uhtred.
Finan! Sihtric!
Father Pyrlig! It’s good to see you are alive.
Even with these Welshmen, we may not be enough.
I know you have summoned Cnut, but you can still turn away with honor.
No one would condemn you for leaving an unfair fight.
I do not fight for honor, Uhtred.
I fight because someone must make a stand against Cnut... even though I am forbidden.
As a sister, I am defiant, but as a daughter of Alfred, I am just doing my duty.
Even if it wasn’t made for me, I can't blindly follow the King's command.
That is something I understand.
Yet I cannot believe he has left me to face this without him.
I thought, somehow, he would find it in his heart.
What do I tell my men?
Tell them your brother is close behind us. They must believe we have a chance.
We've heard from Uhtred and the Lady Aethelflaed.
Where are they?
They’re waiting for you at a place called Tettenhall.
We go?
It mocks the gods to give away the advantage!
I will have my revenge.
There are worse places to defend.
With a few more men, we would stand a chance.
Follow me.
It is prepared.
Will it work?
I do not know.
They're coming.
Get into position!
Follow me!
Mercians to the woods!
To the woods!
If this fails and there is no escape for you... promise me you will find a man you trust to kill you softly.
I have already picked a man.
Be merciful to me, oh God!
When I am afraid, I will trust in You.
In God whose word I praise.
In God I trust.
I will not be afraid.
What can a man do to me?
Nothing.
For you have delivered my soul from death and my feet from stumbling... that I may walk before God.
Something isn’t right.
Die! Die!
No! Wait! Hold back!
Now... charge!
With me!
It's a trick!
Where is he?
Give me your hand! Pull!
Uhtred!
Uhtred, I will cut you into pieces, you murder coward!
Father!
No shame in having a Dane atop you, but, honestly, I've seen prettier.
The ridge, Father!
It's Aethelred!
Can they reach us?
Charge!
Who fights alongside Aethelflaed?
The Mercian fyrds, her husband, even the Welsh.
Christians united.
And without Wessex to lead them forward.
It’s the Lady Aethelflaed!
There she is! Surround her!
There are too many of them.
Get her!
Aldhelm.
Withdraw! You will not take her from us!
You do not have the courage.
Aldhelm, you must.
Since you are Alfred's daughter, I'll let you choose which of us humps you first.
Aldhelm, please. I can't. I can't.
You Saxons have...
Lord King!
Stay close!
Hold fast, men! Hold your lines!
They are fleeing to the forest!
Stop them!
Uhtred!
What the...
My Lord! My Lord!
Push on, men... to victory!
Uhtred!
Finally.
Fight me.
Fight me!
murder!
You killed my firstborn.
You killed my boy! Why?
It was fair revenge for Ragnar!
Ragnar!
Ragnar was weak... and I needed him to die!
But my son... my son was innocent!
Brida...
Give me your seax!
Give me your seax!
You sent Aethelwold to kill Ragnar?
Because...
Because we're destined to be together. You know this.
Please, my love.
Your boys live.
The body your man saw was a Mercian, killed by Danish hands.
Both... both survive? Both.
But you will not live to see them grow old.
You should not have trusted him.
Keep up!
Send me to Valhalla.
They will take you as a prisoner.
That’s worse than death. Please, I cannot be a slave.
Let me die with honor here on the battlefield.
You owe me that, Uhtred.
I want to be with Ragnar. Please, Uhtred.
Please.
Take the pagan bitch!
Brida.
King Hywel, you have done all Christians proud.
It is an honor to meet you.
And I am pleased you were able to make the battle, Lord.
Well, we would not have won without you and your men.
I am most grateful.
And your generous rewards are appreciated.
Your priest conveyed to me your kind offer of the spoils of battle.
Of course. It is the least your bravery deserves.
May it strengthen our new union.
As we are united in faith... let us be united in prosperity and security!
I promise you, we shall feast tonight!
There will be no alliance and no more favors.
The people of Wealas do not need Saxon help.
The Lord favored us.
I've just sent Brida to her doom.
It is battle.
What matters is we both survived and Mercia is safe.
My Lord King. My Lord.
Sire.
My Lord...
He dares to walk amongst the fallen? Do not.
There has been enough fighting.
Your men need you.
Lady, the triumph is all yours.
You led us to a great victory they will speak of for years to come.
And I thank you I am alive to see it.
I probably wasn't the man for that task.
Edward, thank you.
If it were not for you, I would be amongst the dead.
I came despite my better judgment.
I do not take your defiance lightly.
Yes, but surely it was a great victory. With a great loss of many men.
Steapa is dead.
No. Yes.
The man who has stood since our childhood like a giant oak.
He stood with our father, then with us.
Now he's been taken in a battle of your making, sacrificed for your husband's ambition and for yours.
No, I have no ambition.
You seek to be loved by all... chronicled for your bravery, no matter if it costs the blood of men.
That is not true. Yes, it is.
You've chosen Mercia over the kingdom of Alfred.
I suggest you do not return south for a long time.
You should not exile me from Winchester.
I fear you would not be welcome there, Lady.
The widows of these men will not forgive you easily.
Still, you may receive adoration in this place.
It may be some compensation.
None of this was done for anything but love of my country!
Come away from this place, Lord King.
I have been made to look a fool... unable to reward my own men, paying tribute to the Welsh.
This will be made right.
What excuses did he make for his cowardice?
He wanted to avoid bloodshed for his men.
Which created more bloodshed.
I have to speak with him. No!
At least not now.
The Danes are defeated. Let us just enjoy the peace... just for one night.
I will do as you ask...
just for one night.
Let us go, take advantage of the chaos.
He can believe you died in battle. No. I have half killed myself fighting.
I will find him and I will beg him.
He will never forgive us for what we have done. It is over for us, brother.
Clear a path! Move! Stand aside!
Lord Aethelred is wounded. Fetch a healer!

SEASON: 04
EPISODE: 03
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred.
After many long and patient years, I have journeyed north to take back my birthright.
So, Bebbanburg's weakened. For now.
I have reunited with my son and we have begun to forge a bond.
Uhtred, you see these two monks? They’re leaving for Bebbanburg.
Follow them. I will try and do as you need.
And my life-long friend Beocca has joined us on this mission.
You came to help me be a better father.
Well, there is that.
In Mercia, Lord Aethelred’s military commander Eardwulf has sought an alliance.
I heard there was a Dane willing to betray his kinsfolk for money.
Perhaps we are fated to work together...
Lord Arse-licker.
Aethelred has now left his stronghold Aegelesburg undefended and vulnerable.
In Wessex, pressure mounts on King Edward to intervene.
Edward, you must not delay. Enough!
I will decide how to respond to this affront and when!
And while the Saxons are in turmoil...
Go, go, go!
... my men and I have Bebbanburg within our grasp.
But we aren’t prepared for what lies ahead.
You have lost everything...
Osbert.
Put down the bow.
Destiny is all.
My father's weakness drew you here as it drew me.
He could not hold his lands, so I have put him out of his misery.
Your men, to the wall.
Go. Be ready.
Move!
Have faith. Your father has escaped worse than this.
Your father stole these lands from me, when I was a boy!
And he allowed the Scots to ravage them!
If you want men to call you the true lord of Bebbanburg... earn it!
Come down and fight me like a man!
I hold the fortress!
I have no need to fight you.
Wihtgar! Lord!
You do not know me. I was your father's priest.
I knew his strength and his flaws.
This enmity was of his making!
You have settled that!
Now let us make peace.
You are cousins! Let this be a new beginning.
Unite against your common foe.
Together, you can defeat the Scots, secure your land, for the sake of your children.
For all Saxons.
You have spent too long in Winchester, priest.
And you have forgotten the north. We do not seek peace.
You are a stranger here, Uhtred Ragnarson.
But I am wiser than my father.
I will not leave a rival alive to challenge my birthright... or my bloodline.
I will kill you, Uhtred.
But first... you will watch the death of your boy. No!
And all the fools who followed you to your doom.
Don’t! Finan, drop your swords!
Now!
This is the end, Uhtred.
Your name will be forgotten.
Uhtred...
Beocca!
No!
Beocca!
Make for the ship!
They came from the sea gate. Destroy their ship!
Wihtgar's gone to the walls! They'll try to sink the ship!
Lord!
No, Lord! No!
You cannot take him! All the men will die if you do not go now.
Uhtred, please!
Watch out!
Lord, we must go! Lord, he’s gone! Come on!
Aim for their ship!
Untie the ship! Osferth, untie the ship!
Release!
We need to leave soon!
Get in the boat!
We need to get away!
Osferth, start bailing! Where is Uhtred?
They're over there! We need to go now!
Get going!
Go! Get in the boat!
Lord! We don't have time!
Uhtred, hurry! They'll try to sink the bastard boat!
Come on, Father! Ready the oars!
Easy! Pull!
Do we follow them?
No. He has failed.
He will not last the night.
Pull!
Pull!
Pull!
Pull!
Pull!
Pull!
If we move forward with this, we stand a chance against Cnut’s army.
Father Pyrlig, you have news from Mercia? Does Cnut march on Wessex?
Cnut has left Aegelesburg and is camped near Tameworthig.
And Aethelred? Do we know where he has gone?
Aethelred has ridden into Daneland and ravages East Anglia.
He has left his lands undefended and allowed Cnut to shatter the peace. His ambition is madness.
And Christian men and women in Mercia are dying for it.
With Aethelred gone, they expect your aid, Lord King.
Cnut has not set a camp at Tameworthig to pillage.
He's cleverer than we imagined.
For years, he has watched us building burhs in Wessex.
This assault is a provocation to draw us out into the open and Cnut has chosen the place where he means to fight.
There is high ground near Tameworthig.
If he waits there and we come to him, he will defeat us.
We must fight him, Lord King.
Mercia burns like a lighted fart. That is Aethelred's responsibility.
Lord King.
We have delayed too long already. When do you ride?
My people suffer, Edward, men who fought alongside Wessex many times.
I know it!
But you ask me to risk ten sons of Wessex to save ten sons of Mercia.
These are my people.
I will not send them to be slaughtered while Cnut sets the terms of the battle!
And your duty to your allies, my Lord? I am King of Wessex.
I am sworn to protect it.
Your father was crowned King of Wessex, but he always sought to unite the Christian peoples.
In spirit, he was King of all Saxons.
My father is not here.
Aethelred must return.
Father Pyrlig, you will dispatch messengers to find him.
Steapa will ready our guards.
When our armies are united, we will face Cnut together.
By the time Aethelred returns, there will be no Mercia to defend.
This is your decision?
It is.
You will not oppose it.
Edward!
The Ealdormen remain in Aegelesburg?
Any that were not killed in the attack. Aethelflaed...
Edward betrays his father's memory.
He acts in the interests of Wessex. Perhaps my father would've done the same.
Never!
I am Mercian.
I was married to Alfred to knit the two kingdoms together, as you were to Aethelred.
If Mercia falls, then Wessex stands alone against the Danes.
My duty is now to Mercia, not Wessex.
If there is anything I can do, I must do it.
I must go to Aegelesburg to summon the Mercian fyrds.
Edward will see this as defiance... betrayal.
Edward is not my king.
And you will throw yourself into the path of the Danes?
Aethelflaed, you are a target!
You'll be killed... or held for ransom and not for the first time!
There is no one else to go.
You must not tell Edward I am gone until I have left Winchester.
Promise me.
Then you must choose a place for the fyrds to assemble.
There is a valley in Tettenhall, where lesser numbers might stand a chance.
This is where you must force the Danes to fight.
The fyrds will not be enough.
I will need Edward's aid.
When you're gone, I will speak to him.
Your brother will not abandon you.
Edward will be there.
What do you have for me, Bjorgulf? The head of a Saxon turd.
So, another village burns in Mercia!
The smell of Saxon blood stiffens our warriors for battle!
But I hope not your cock.
I have no choice here, but to act the part of his whore.
He tries to dress me to make me his property.
I swear, I detest the man.
Come with me. I have news that will put the King in better spirits.
I gave you a gift. Why are you not wearing it?
Am I not beautiful enough without it?
On the surface.
What do you want?
For you, Lord King.
Ah.
Ripped from the hands of an ugly Dane named Ulf.
We've taken Lindcylne. Word will spread.
And Edward will hear of it.
He will hear that your kingdom grows greater than Wessex.
That you have taken what Alfred never could.
While Edward looks like a weak and timid boy.
You have done well, Eardwulf.
You will be rewarded.
I only ask that I retain command of your armies, Lord King.
And to restore my family's name.
To lift your decree that every generation be born into disgrace.
Take all of East Anglia and I shall consider it.
You are generous, Lord King.
My brother and I will withdraw to pray for your swift victory.
You may go.
For now.
Lord?
Uhtred, the men are tired and hungry.
There's nothing here. We must move on.
Where shall we go?
Somewhere with a fire, an alehouse or a whorehouse that would raise the spirits, eh?
I must go back. I must retrieve his body.
No, Uhtred, you cannot.
Retrieving his body means nothing now.
His journey in this world has ended.
He is left with thieves and traitors!
He should lie beside Thyra where his friends can grieve.
Instead, I led him to die among strangers.
I've lost every family I had.
Beocca was always there... the only constant.
Without Beocca, I have no home.
His death is on my hands. I failed him.
No.
Bless you, Sihtric.
Blessings.
Where is Uhtred?
He walks alone.
I fear his spirit is broken.
The day Uhtred is broken is the day you grow hair down there, Osferth.
It'll never come.
Now, he lost a friend and grieves him... as we all do.
He told me we must return south.
Well, come on. We'll need horses and provisions for the journey.
Buy what you can.
There's a village beyond the ridge.
Try not to spend it all on women.
Frigga, tell me I’m not deceived... that the curse is lifted.
He grows inside me.
Any word of the Saxon armies? Not yet.
We will burn every village in Mercia until Edward comes to fight.
There’s a limit to the suffering the boy king can allow his fellow Christians to bear... and we will exceed it.
Your sons should be here to see this. Haesten will keep them safe.
All my children will inherit everything.
And I will slaughter Edward and Aethelred's armies here.
And when the kings are dead, we will sit together on Alfred's throne.
That is my promise to you. Mm.
Do it for Ragnar.
We do this in his memory.
For Ragnar.
Lady Aelswith.
Lord Aethelhelm.
You have heard? Cnut burns villages from Tofeceaster to fag.
He defiles our holy places and slaughters our priests.
Because I wait for the right moment, it does not mean I do not care.
Edward, I must talk... Lady.
Yes.
My daughter called at the nunnery today.
You said the Lady Aethelflaed had withdrawn there for reflection?
She had.
Then she misled you.
She’s not there.
Concerned for your sister...
I asked Steapa to make further inquiries.
The Lady was seen leaving Winchester.
Where is Aethelflaed?
Mother!
Where has she gone?
She has gone to Mercia.
This cannot be true.
I am sorry, Edward, but what was I to do?
I am of Mercia.
And by marriage, so is Aethelflaed.
We could not leave the people to die.
She defied me... and you defy me.
I only wish to counsel you to follow the Christian path, as I did your father.
You think I do not fear my God?
I know you have true faith.
But the burden of kingship is heavy.
I have experience, Edward. I can share it.
I have given instructions that we will fight Cnut on our terms, when we are prepared and have the best chance of victory!
Now Aethelflaed has walked directly into Cnut's trap!
She puts the men of Wessex and all the Christian kingdoms at risk!
I demand you call her back.
You will show loyalty to your king.
I cannot swear loyalty to a plan that is misguided!
Aethelflaed will summon the Mercian fyrds to Tettenhall.
You must join her.
Lord, forgive my sins for they are all very grave.
Whoever fears you, Lord God, knows that is your will and you'll show that man just...
Stop this nonsense!
I pray for Father Beocca.
Please allow the soul of Father Beocca to rise to heaven...
Get up!
You think he needs your words, hm? Do you think I need them?
I know you blame me for his death.
I am told your God gives mercy.
Where is he?
Where is he?
I’ve never seen him.
It is not my God that you hate... but the fact that I am not you.
Are you all right?
He does not want me! You know, I will return to the church.
And that's what you want, is it? To run away?
I remind him of his defeat... and of Father Beocca's sacrifice.
Oh! The blindness of youth.
Uhtred is a warrior and a father.
It was his job to save you and he could not. That’s what eats at him.
As a warrior perhaps, but not as a father.
He has never been a father. Because he was absent?
Do you know how many battles he's fought?
How many times he’s sworn oaths and risked his life for your Christian kings at the cost of his own hopes and comfort?
I met your father as a slave, when we had... nothing.
Now, you look at what you lack, not what he has given to others.
He fights for Bebbanburg, not for himself, but for you... to give you the legacy he never had.
I swear... he is a great man... and his blood runs in your veins.
You should be proud to follow him.
The men can no longer go on wandering in the wilderness like this.
They will need silver.
There’ll be opportunity to earn it. We’re warriors.
There's always battles to fight.
To fight, men need a lord who can lead them into battle without fear.
I’m tired.
My reputation is waning.
These men depend on you.
I know what you do, Finan. I know what you say to them.
I’m finished with battles.
I thought that my destiny was to return to my home.
I have not.
I have lost my lands.
I've lost my name.
I can no longer call myself Uhtred of Bebbanburg.
I am nothing.
If men want to leave me, you should let them go.
I can no longer be their lord.
Is there word of Aethelflaed?
No.
She forces my hand.
This is not the vision of England that I swore to protect.
Yet, these events could work to your advantage... and serve your father's vision.
Let the Lord of Mercia return to defend his wife and lands.
They say Aethelred has 400 men in East Anglia, no match for Cnut's.
So, the battle will remove the problem of King Aethelred.
Once Aethelred is gone... you will defeat Cnut... and unite the kingdoms.
Edward will fulfill Alfred's dream.
By sacrificing Mercia?
And my sister?
Your father knew that uniting the kingdoms could not come without a cost.
And your sister...
has chosen her own fate.
Beocca would not want you to starve or stay destroyed by grief.
He held me on the ramparts, when Earl Ragnar rode to Bebbanburg with the head of my brother.
When my father named me Uhtred in his stead and told me to die for Bebbanburg...
Beocca was at my side.
He put me into the water to baptize me.
He held me underneath it for so long I nearly drowned while he prayed to his God.
He saved my life as a boy... and as a man... many times.
He was like a father.
Hey, it's all right.
He'll have no grave... no place blessed by his god.
He is with God now.
And with your sister. He is at... peace.
Hm? I'm sure he’d be touched how you mourn for him while we're stuck in the middle of nowhere. But if he were here now, he would tell you this is not the end.
We will gather more men.
We will return with an army and batter down the gates.
Yeah.
What brings you here?
I ride from Wessex with a message from King Edward.
You may tell it to me.
I have instructions to deliver it to Lord Aethelred and him only.
I command the King's Guard.
No doubt you’ve heard stories about the King, about his delicate temperament.
I'm telling you he does not wish to be disturbed, so, if you want to test it...
Cnut's armies have attacked Mercia.
The Lord's estate has fallen.
The heart of Mercia is gone.
They’ve taken everything?
Danes.
It is Haesten. Where is he going?
He’s with his kinfolk. He'll not want to fight.
Uhtred Ragnarson!
I thought I could smell something rotten on the air!
We should kill him now, Lord, while we have the chance.
I've had enough of fighting Danes, even weasels like Haesten.
Uhtred and his pretty boys... looking so sad and far from home.
Why?
It's none of your concern. Let us pass and I will not cut off your head.
I suppose, once more, you ride out to save the Lady Aethelflaed.
Continue if you like, Uhtred.
It seems fate has brought us together again.
Your men look like ragged dogs in need of meat and we have plenty.
We camp here tonight.
Join us.
Haesten's men say Cnut and Brida have attacked Mercia.
I knew they did not sail for Irland.
Edward and Aethelred will need us now.
I owe them nothing.
And Aethelflaed?
It is true, I fear for her.
Uhtred.
Join me.
There was a rumor you had gone north to regain your lands.
Are you here with your tail between your legs?
Your men say the Danes have gone to war, yet you are here, playing nursemaid.
What happened, Haesten? Have they cut off your balls?
What can I say? I’m a family man.
I do not see your fat wife.
She died.
Oh, did she? Mm.
As you know, I once had the desire to claim Mercia and Wessex for my own.
But that did not go well for me.
And now, like you, Uhtred, I only want a woman to hump and a piece of land to call my own.
I had both, in Skade and Beamfleot... until you took them away from me.
How is Aethelflaed?
In my experience, the bitch has never known when to lie down.
No doubt she'll be riding into battle with Cnut... with her silly husband and her pretty brother.
And you have always been there to save her, Uhtred.
But not now.
She does not need me.
Mm.
That’s not what I heard.
How is she?
To bed?
I imagine she squeals, like a big fat pig.
Stop it!
Come on, Uhtred! We were having a nice dinner.
Of course, I would slit her throat after she’d been ridden!
Wait, Uhtred. She’s too well used to fight over.
Now I will kill you!
Wait, wait, wait! There is something I can give you.
The name of the man that killed Ragnar...
Huh?
Aethelwold! No.
He held the dagger, but another whispered poison into his ear.
Let me live... and I'll tell you who gave the command.
Speak.
Cnut.
He wanted to lead the Danes... and he wanted Ragnar's woman who used to be yours.
He told Aethelwold that Ragnar would kill him.
He guided the blade... into Ragnar's heart.
These are Cnut's sons...
hm?
You can go.
You will leave Cnut's bastards behind.
I’m tired of the red-headed runts.
You can take them.
Of course Cnut will hear of this. I said go!
Finan!
Lord. Tie them up!
Let go! Come on.
Jesus!
No, no, no! Where are you going? Where are you going?
Cnut’s sons?
I thought you did not want to be a part of this war.
Brother?
What have you done?
I had to or all is lost.
The rider came from Wessex. Edward sends word to Aethelred.
Cnut did not sail to Irland.
The Danes have sacked Aegelesburg and taken Mercia.
Then you were tricked.
Yes, the Dane Haesten gave me false information.
And Aethelred left Mercia undefended upon my advice.
You see now why he cannot receive this message.
But if Aethelred loses Mercia, then we lose our position!
You think I do not see that?
Do you think I can bear to return to nothing?
But there is benefit in delaying our return.
If the Lady Aethelflaed throws herself into the path of the Danes, it will leave a path open for you.
I've no need of a husband who used to be king!
You must tell Aethelred the truth and persuade him to defend his kingdom.
If I tell him the truth, he will kill me.
I will do all I can to soften the blow.
Leave us.
Be careful, lady.
Like you...
I'm tired of caution.
What will you do with the boys?
We will take them to Aethelflaed in Mercia.
I remember watching you ride out from Winchester... before you fought at the battle of Fearnham.
I remember.
Your mother was there.
It was the last time I saw her.
I still see her...
in my dreams.
Gisela.
But then I wake and she's gone again.
I feel her loss also... every day.
That day I asked her why you left us.
And she said you fought, because you believed in a cause... not for God, or the gods... or for Saxons, or for Danes.
But to keep safe the people that you love.
She said that is why you will always have the strength to stand up when others fall and to go on when those around you say it is hopeless.
It is why these men love you... and will follow you wherever you go.
As will I.
Creoda.
Lady Aethelflaed.
How many remain here?
Where is the king?
We will find you food.
Search for survivors and bring them here.
We should not delay here. The Danes could return.
I know.
I have summoned the Mercian fyrds.
They are marching to Tettenhall.
Cnut will pay for this bloodshed.
My husband valued loyalty.
I have been loyal.
At least as far as I can remember. But he was also practical.
If he saw a person make the wrong decision... he took action to correct it.
Edward's rule in Wessex is vulnerable... and Mercia has been left undefended by its king.
Wessex needs our protection... and the support of all our Christian allies.
You will take a message to the Welsh king, Hywel.
Lady, you are Edward's kin. If I disobey him, he will string me up in the marketplace! I know what I ask.
But you have sworn an oath to God, Father.
What use is your mortal life if you disobey your conscience for fear of man's vengeance?
You and I must protect the faith, Father Pyrlig.
Aethelflaed is expecting an army.
We must deliver one.
So, the Lady Aethelflaed has returned to Mercia.
Do you think she's alone?
If she is, the rest of the Saxons will not be far behind.
Take her and they are in our power.
You will find Aethelflaed and you will bring her to me.
Horsemen!
Wake the Lady Aethelflaed now. Lord.
Uhtred!
What are you doing here?
You two, get those boys off the horses.
Why are you not at Bebbanburg?
What happened?
Where are the guards?
You see all we have. Uhtred, who are those boys?
You should not be here without a guard.
Where should I be? Decorating Edward's palace?
My place is in Mercia!
What have you done, Uhtred?
They are Cnut's heirs.
Then Cnut will hear of this and he will come for you.
So, you must get the boys to your armies. Where are they?
Aethelred is in East Anglia with his men.
I have ordered the Mercian fyrd to Tettenhall, and I believe Edward will meet us there, then we will summon Cnut to fight.
So, you've put yourself in danger.
I do not know if Aethelred is coming and I had to force Edward's hand.
You should not be here undefended. Finan.
Lord. We leave at first light.
Aldhelm, prepare the survivors.
We march to Tettenhall at dawn.
Every man must be put to watch.
Positions.
Every man to the ramparts!
Uhtred, what happened at Bebbanburg?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SEASON: 04
EPISODE: 02
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred.
My birthright Bebbanburg was cruelly taken by my Uncle Aelfric.
My greatest fighters... or the most fearful?
His men desert him and the Scots send raiders, who weaken those that remain.
How many did we lose this time?
The time is right for me to take back what is mine.
Give me 100 men. It will take a week.
Two hundred, I can take it in a day.
But the new king, Edward, has fallen under the influence of Lord Aethelhelm.
I'm no longer the boy who can be bent to your will!
Aethelred of Mercia looks to Bebbanburg for a different purpose.
I'm collecting all the bones of our beloved saint as a good omen to signal to the Mercian people that I shall restore their lands to greatness.
He has sent holy men there to bargain for an ancient relic.
I have also sought out the help of a Christian.
Hello, Father.
My son, who was taken by Alfred and raised with a devout faith.
The Mercian commander Eardwulf has traveled to East Anglia to meet with Haesten.
Did you see them leave?
Yes. They’re dismantling their camp and packing their boats.
And now Aethelred looks to conquer Daneland as well as Eardwulf’s sister.
The feelings that Aethelflaed and I have always held can no longer be contained.
But for now, my duty draws me to the north once again.
To Bebbanburg!
Destiny is all!
Rán can be a vixen.
This should settle her.
Rán is pagan lies. I pity you for believing it.
Finan, give him something to do. Yes, Lord!
Oh, God. Whoa.
Hey! You can empty this.
Tell me the truth.
Am I the bait? For what?
In the plan you are hiding from me.
Am I the bait? Nothing is hidden from you.
We are tracking monks who have entry to Bebbanburg.
You will befriend them, enter Bebbanburg and open the sea gate to us.
I think you have another reason for dragging me into your revenge.
Yes, so you may win honor and reputation.
The only reputation that matters is my standing with God.
You cannot force a boy to be a warrior.
My blood runs within his veins. Why can he not see that?
Because your blood is that of a stubborn bastard!
Our Father... Who do you pray for, boy?
Hm? The men you will slaughter.
You seem to take things when you want them.
When you do, show mercy.
To my Uncle Aelfric, who spent a lifetime wishing me dead?
There is a power in forgiveness. Good.
Then you may use it to forgive me.
He continues to sign himself King of Mercia, and now we hear he leads troops out of Aegelesburg.
Aethelred has always been ambitious.
Do you know where he's gone? My husband doesn’t inform me of anything.
I know he is seeking the bones of St. Oswald.
Edward, that is grave.
If he is seeking St. Oswald, he is seeking to break from Wessex.
Many Mercians believe that uniting the body of the saint will restore their land to greatness.
Yes, but the people want peace, not war.
Still, it is a signal of intention.
Or a ploy to pander to the simple folk of Mercia.
The people of Mercia are not simple.
Well, whatever it is he is doing... do not allow yourself to be drawn in.
The weak should not be allowed to set terms.
If you do not play, he cannot win.
Leave childishness to the little children.
Ah. Here he is, the future King of all the realm.
See how nimble he is!
That’s a great swordsman in the making!
Yes, indeed.
Lady. Lord.
Yes, and he is a child of great authority, too.
You should have seen the way he kicked Steapa to make his displeasure known.
A boy of many talents.
Come with me.
I want to show you a book of your grandfather's.
Do not pester the boy with Latin.
He is to be a king, not a clerk.
The men of Wessex are fighters.
Rule the sword and rule the land.
He digs away at all that is precious.
Yes, it is troubling... as are my husband's intentions.
I will ask Aldhelm to make inquiries.
Father Pyrlig?
Bring Father Beocca to me.
I was a little unjust with him... and wish to ask his advice on a certain person.
Father Beocca has left Winchester, Lady.
He felt there was nothing left here for him. I doubt he will ever return.
And so our allies abandon us.
Lady, you asked for him to be removed.
Yes.
Yes, I suppose I did.
Just as I asked my son to be married to that vain, silly girl.
Why the Lord guided me this way, I cannot fathom.
Maybe the Lord didn't.
Any path I chose was to secure the country my husband loved.
And how well did that work, Lady?
A pathetic hoard, most of them drunk or senile. The Scots will laugh.
I cannot hold them off with this! We need more warriors.
I have been trying, Lord.
The slaver can get us trained men, but he wants 10,000.
Ten thousand would empty the treasury. What good is a fortress without silver?
Lord, we must sell the heart of Saint Oswald.
Time is moving against us.
We can only sustain these attacks from the Scots for so long.
He's desperate for it, you say, Aethelred?
This is what I have heard.
The monks he dispatched will arrive here soon.
Then we shall bleed silver from him and buy the men.
So, where do we start?
Where do you look for monks in a place like this?
St. Colman's? The whorehouse!
That’s it. I’m staying on the boat.
It’s not safe for you to be alone this deep within Danelaw.
Come. Then I will pray for salvation.
I will stay with him, keep us both safe.
They do not love a priest in Grimesby. Thank you, Father.
To the whorehouse then!
You misjudge your father, you know.
He’s not the bloodthirsty heathen you take him for.
Thou shalt not kill, Father Beocca.
Or are you rusty on the scripture? I know the teaching.
But I also know Aelfric.
And having some years on you, I also know... that sometimes one must do wrong to do right.
Aelfric tried to kill a child for no gain but wooden walls.
And for that, he wrenched a boy from his Christian life... delivered him to the heathens and damned his soul to all eternity.
Uhtred is avenging a great wrong done to him.
Help him in his mission and you will be helping...
Helping him return to a life of Christian piety?
No.
Not that, but... There is a chance.
All sinners can repent.
Well, we shall see.
Come on.
Grimesby seems like a lovely place.
I hear the oysters are delicious. Hm.
Sihtric, don't make eye contact.
What’s your business here? We’re traders.
We’re taking pelts to Frankia.
Really? Mm-hm.
Well, you keep trouble out of my alehouse, agreed?
Hey, we’re just hungry for some food, nothing more.
And do you have women? He needs a woman.
We’re not that sort of alehouse.
Finan.
She's yours until nightfall.
If you’re quick, you can both get a turn.
He’ll certainly be quick.
Hey, why do I always have to pretend to be the virgin?
Because no one would believe I am the virgin.
Harder, like your sister does it.
hit it.
Lead me out to the darkness, Lord.
And let this sin...
I’m a virgin in that, Lord. I’m sure you are, Osferth.
We’ve found our monks.
Oi, watching costs extra.
Harder!
Traveling overnight, all that way in the saddle with a red raw ass, a good thing they like pain!
It takes six days to get to Bebbanburg on the coast road.
They’ll get there before Ascension.
I'm a good Christian boy, Lord.
You should not arrive before them.
The rocks around Bebbanburg do not treat ships kindly.
So, we wait here and enjoy the atmosphere?
Uhtred, see these two monks? They're the ones we’ve been searching for.
They’re leaving for Bebbanburg. Follow them.
It's our strongest chance of getting into the fortress.
I can’t simply follow... If there were, I would not ask.
My men have been there recently. They would be recognized.
So, I am the sacrificial lamb... You are our greatest hope.
Do not do this for me.
Do it for your descendants. Whatever I take will one day be yours.
I'm not the warrior you seem to mistake me for.
Why do you have this faith in me?
Because I know that the spirit of our family is within you.
That will give you a strength that you do not know yet.
I will try and do as you need, but I will not kill a man.
That is all I want.
Three pieces of silver says he runs home.
Take this horse. Uhtred.
Ride the road north, close to the shore.
Leave now, so you can be ahead of the monks.
Find them. Join them.
Lord! I would not send you to be slaughtered.
When I see you signal, I will approach the sea gate.
He'll be looked after.
He's blessed, as are you.
All right, come on.
Uhtred.
Try it on.
I will, when you leave.
No. I had it made for you.
I want to see it now.
Lord, I will not undress before you.
I am a woman from a noble family. Whose father disgraced...
Whose father was unfairly shamed for no reason other than falling from the Ealdormen's favor.
Lady, enough of this game.
You have no good reason to deny me.
I act simply for the good of your soul.
You have a wife.
You are right.
I see that now.
I should make myself a widower and marry you.
Is that not what you want?
Along with all of these silks and furs.
Just... a good life.. for a girl who has nothing.
Am I being very unfair?
Have I misjudged your Christian soul?
It can all be arranged.
Did you do the deed? No.
Drag it out much longer, he’ll lose interest.
How wrong you are. He's not losing interest.
He's threat to have Lady Aethelflaed killed, so that he may marry me.
That is good news!
No, it is not! I would have the blood of Alfred's daughter on my hands.
It seems like a fair exchange.
Married to a man who kills those who displease him?
Again, it seems like... He is volatile and we must be careful.
Promise me, if he asks you to attack Lady Aethelflaed, you will refuse.
I will never defy the wishes of King Aethelred.
And nor should you.
We will rest here and attack at first light.
Catch the Mercians sleeping in their beds.
How far is Aegelesburg?
Close enough to surprise them. Then this is where I say goodbye.
We camp here tonight, march at dawn!
You are certain we cannot tempt you to battle?
I have no interest in fighting, only women and silver.
Because you have to pay women to hump them?
Better than reeling them in with lies.
Fair. But everything I did allowed the Danes to triumph.
You will miss a great gathering of armies, Haesten.
Edward is honor-bound to defend the land of his sister and mother.
Aethelred's death will force swift retaliation.
We will ride into Mercia in a fury and will force them to a battle place where we have the advantage.
Wessex, Mercians, all Christians.
This will bring them together.
Then you will have united the Saxons.
Alfred would be very proud.
Cnut! Let’s go.
Boys, come here.
I want you to go with our friend Haesten.
He will take you north until our campaign is over.
Should they not witness the battle? I know it’s dangerous but...
There will be battles to come. Today, they are too young.
Haesten, attend to them and teach them nothing you know.
Come, boys, let’s get you ready.
The shit loves his offspring.
How did he draw you to him?
We made a bond in blood.
If you ever get bored of the ugly bastard... you know, I have fathered ten children.
That is of no use to me. No?
No... because you carry his pup!
I can tell by the tits.
If you tell him this before I fight the Saxons...
I will cut off your balls and feed them to you.
I'm overjoyed for you, Brida.
The world needs more little Cnuts.
Brida!
Hm? Come.
Rest tonight. Prepare yourselves. There will be many sleepless nights ahead!
But, at daybreak, we shall strike and blood will run!
Mercia will burn!
Bring me Aethelred!
Where is he?
Where’s your Lord?
Where’s your Lord?
Next!
Are there any more?
Could they be mercenaries... come to help defend us?
A donation from the slaver?
Offering reinforcements from the goodness of his heart?
Well, perhaps they will turn away.
Or they are Scots, returning for a fight.
There is one choice, though it sickens me to say it.
Pay them to go away.
So they can return again and we pay them more?
Why not just beg them to make us their vassals?
I did not say it was a good choice.
Send men out to speak with them.
If they return with heads on their shoulders, we know that the Scots might negotiate.
I shall go myself. I am sick of sending men to slaughter.
Which is why you will never lead, Aidan.
Open the gate.
Alert Lord Aelfric.
He'll want to see this.
We heard you were drowned.
We were assured. They said there was no hope.
I nearly did drown, Father.
I believed it was my punishment for sending you away.
No punishment.
Just a moment to learn how much I wanted to live... and return to you and Bebbanburg.
I thought my legacy was lost forever.
I assure you, your descendants will thrive.
When I got word you were under attack, I seized the moment.
I've brought warriors... men I've collected from every corner of the known world.
Strong men, loyal men.
Bebbanburg is saved.
As magnificent as ever it was.
Indeed... if it is real and not a dream.
It is real enough.
We need get no closer at this point. Lord!
Drop the sail!
Row inland and keep under the shadow of the cliff.
How long do we wait for your son to send a sign?
Until it comes.
It is all the will of the gods now.
Is this some plan to become a saint?
It is preparation for the royal consecration.
Becoming Queen is a now a holy rite?
The insult of it.
I take it this was also Lord Aethelhelm's idea.
Yes. He is quiet, but his ambitions for his family grow.
He obsesses over the aetheling and pushes me aside.
Had I known what sort of man he was, I would've selected a different bride for your brother.
What does the King say?
Edward cherishes peace... both within Wessex and within the palace.
So, I must accept when I am no longer wanted.
She feels my father's loss.
As do we all.
I would like 17 candles lit on my behalf.
One at each shrine and no mumbling in the prayers.
The Lord wants to hear your full hearts.
Seventeen?
Is something on your conscience, Lady?
Many things. I fear I’ve allowed too much to change in the palace.
Tell me, the young Centish lady, Ecgwynn...
The girl who married your son in secret?
Yes.
What do you know of her present situation?
She took holy orders, when her marriage was forcibly annulled.
And, from what I’ve heard, she's very unhappy.
Well, the cloistered life may not suit a simple girl.
She was forbidden from seeing the two children she bore your son.
Her daughter she sees occasionally, but her son... she's not looked on since he was taken from her arms.
That seems a cruel punishment.
For the crime of loving Edward and Edward loving her, yes.
You and Beocca are right to question my mistreatment of her.
I would like to make amends, in a small way.
Where is her son now? He lives in a monastery.
So, he has a love of God... but not that of a mother.
An agony I would not want for my own son.
I would like to see them both. I can have it arranged.
I am presuming you do not want anyone else to know.
It would put the boy in danger.
We both know that.
Send scouts to look for a battle place.
Make sure the grain stores are emptied and no food remains.
Gut this palace before the other Saxons retaliate!
Did you see the Ealdormen? I did.
You're inventive in your cruelty. Have you found Aethelred?
Not yet. I'm just enjoying his bed.
Would you like to join me?
What are you reading, child?
You are Aethelstan, are you not?
Yes.
Who are your family, Aethelstan?
I’ve been told not to answer that.
Indeed. That is probably wise.
Are you an abbess, Lady?
No. I am... a friend.
Though many great abbesses feel I could have been one of their number.
Come with me, Aethelstan.
A lady wants to meet you.
Go to the garden.
Oh, Lord help us! It is a beggar. Don't look at him. Ignore him.
I cannot. He's heading straight for us.
Travelers!
He looks insane!
Be wary!
Ignore him.
Travelers, this road is full of murder thieves!
Be careful, my brothers in Christ! Why do you call us brothers, madman?
Because I am one of your number. You look a beggar.
No! I am a deacon, cruelly kidnapped from his church.
A boy whose mind is spent and life is ebbing!
Let me ride with you. We should move on.
In the name of the Virgin, there are bandits on this road!
Abandon me and I shall perish and lie here unburied!
Come on.
Please, did Christ not pity the leper?
Please, brothers. I know about your sins in Grimesby.
Don’t let me speak of it to your abbot.
What do you want?
Nothing but traveling companions. I swear to it, I mean you no harm.
Are you any good in a fight? No.
Good, they can kill you while we escape.
Are you the kind soul who arranged this meeting?
I am.
Do I know you, madam?
Content yourself with knowing that I am a mother who feels for your plight.
Then I thank you. To see him even briefly heals a wounded heart... for both of us.
You have shown us a great mercy.
Tell me... am I still out of favor to the Lady Aelswith?
Lady Aelswith disfavored no one.
She simply chose what was best for her son... as you will want the best for yours.
What is best for my son is what he once had, a mother and a father living in happiness.
Perhaps. What is done is done.
But yes, it would be foolish for him to be raised without a woman's nurture.
Men raised by men turn savage.
So we must ensure there is always a lady to guide him... when he is permanently moved to somewhere more secure.
Why must he be moved?
There is concern that he could be in danger in Wessex.
But rest assured, he will be well-protected.
But I am afraid you will not be able to visit again.
Why am I being punished?
Did I deserve this cruelty?
Did I hurt someone as I am now hurt?
Did he?
All I wanted was a husband and family!
To be with the one I loved in a quiet place to call home.
Then you would have been unsuited to life in the palace at Winchester, Ecgwynn.
Which is why this has all come to pass.
Stop staring at me. I’m not staring.
Mm-hm.
I'm admiring your appetite. Does death make you hungry?
Have they found Aethelred? Yes.
Good. And where has that little turd hidden himself?
He's in East Anglia. He has attacked farms there and many Danish settlers were killed.
There is no way that fool outwitted us.
It sickens me to say he has.
No...
This was not his doing, but ours.
He thought we were in Irland, that there would be no reprisals!
We have let this happen, Cnut!
Then we must prevail now.
Farmers and their families die in war. It’s just the way of things.
Danish settlers, Saxon children... they pay the price.
Besides, if Aethelred has left his people undefended, they will be easier to slaughter, and slaughter will bring Edward sooner.
I knew it! I said this! I said Cnut was trying to trick us!
What of Lord Aethelred? Is he dead? I will try to find out.
Call off the coronation. Send men to Aegelesburg to retake it.
No, do not call off the ceremony...
You cannot leave the Mercians to their doom.
By the sounds of things, we’re too late.
Send men... you must!
What they did to humiliate the Ealdormen, Lord King! It must be avenged!
Lord King... They are men of honor, men of my blood!
We should not act in haste.
Maybe Aethelred's right... Edward, you must not delay.
Enough!
I will decide how to respond to this affront and when!
Not you, nor you, nor you will set the terms.
And certainly not Cnut.
Hard to tell!
Maybe 40 helmets!
He has put all his men on the ramparts to make it look like he has more.
He was always a cunning one. Still two against one.
We're twice as good. Yeah, keep saying it, it becomes true.
We don't need to slaughter 'em all, just hold 'em off.
Lord, the real fight will be you against Aelfric.
Tell me, Beocca...
is it the right time?
I'm not leading men to defeat?
You are not leading men to defeat.
The fight will be furious. Men will fall.
But I would not encourage you, if I thought you would lose.
Feel the air here, Uhtred.
Feel its cold breath.
This is the air that you and I were born to breathe.
We’re meant to be here.
Let us see if my blood runs thick... if the signal comes.
Do you know what that is? It's a fort.
Beating heart of this land they called Bernicia.
Bebbanburg.
The lord who resides here is volatile, so be on your guard.
What if he does not welcome us? Then we will not be welcomed home.
And we will be forced to sail to Frisia to sell your backside in return for food.
It is only monks, Lord.
Aethelred's errand boys.
Let’s see how desperate they are for my holy treasures.
Greetings to Lord Aelfric of Bebbanburg.
I am Brother Iestyn.
We are sent by Aethelred of Mercia to make a trade.
Um, you can turn back.
I’ve decided I cannot bear to part with so dear a treasure.
Lord Aethelred will offer a good price.
I put no price on holy relics, nor should you.
The legacy of my forebears cannot be measured in silver.
Then might we at least rest the night here, Lord?
The road has been long.
Perhaps we could discuss the trade.
We are not a lodging house!
Your master has sent you on a pointless errand.
If Aethelred wishes to reunite the relics of the beloved saint, he’ll have to fight me for them, sword to sword.
Lord!
I am but a young man, but since my childhood, I have heard that Bebbanburg was the greatest fortress in the north.
And that its true lord was a man of honor and great reputation.
Well, who does not take to a little flattery?
Please, Lord.
I’ve traveled many weeks just to admire it.
Reject our plea to sell us your riches, but... do not deny my boyhood dream.
Well, I am generous and a loyal servant to the Church.
So, um... you are welcome.
Put them in the slave quarters.
Stop looking impressed.
You will push up the price.
Has he given the signal? Lord.
Nothing.
Did you see that?
There, look!
It’s the signal!
Move your arses!
Follow us along the rocks.
The rest of you stay here until I call for the ship.
Which one do you want?
That one.
All yours.
Halt!
Do not move!
Are you there?
Keep this way. Backs against the wall.
Are you there?
What do we do, Lord?
Do we lift the gate?
It’s worth a try. Come on, lift it!
On my count, one, two, three!
Come on! Put your back into it!
Finan, stop. It’s too heavy.
Move!
This is a mistake. I was lost!
You were trying to steal away! I was not!
Why? Huh? Why?
Get me those oars.
In there, Osferth.
Put your back into it!
Come on! It’s moving! Come on!
Can you get under it, Lord?
A little more.
Go on, Lord!
Summon all to the yard.
Get up!
Let them see how we get thieves to tell the truth.
Go on, Lord!
Come on!
Heave! Heave!
He's got it! He's got it! He's got it!
Yes! Yes!
Is it a trap? Is it a trap we can fight our way out of?
Again, who...
...do you really... serve?
My flock and God himself!
You, what is your mission? Simply to...
Must I kill another before I get the truth?
Let the holy man go free.
He means you no harm!
This one schemes against us, Father.
He is a spy.
We move on.
Who sent you?
Hm?
You can tell me. Have the Scots allied with Aethelred?
No recognition in his eyes, but his face... is familiar somehow.
You are an imposter... but for whom?
Who are you?
I am Uhtred of Bebbanburg!
It is unwise to mock me.
kill him.
Guards... Silence!
Only I shall speak! Get back!
Well done!
Do you know who I am?
Hm? Do you know who I am?
I am the true Lord of Bebbanburg!
And I am taking it back!
I have no fight with you.
Only this man is doomed.
Are you happy to see me, Uncle? Huh?
I have waited a lifetime to avenge myself.
I will enjoy taking my time with you! Mm?
No one else will suffer, if you swear loyalty.
None of you are my enemies. You are men of Bebbanburg!
And, as Lord of Bebbanburg, I will provide for and protect you!
And this cruel shit, who has hated you and mistreated you, will die.
I've come home!
Swear to me and you will have my oath.
Aidan... you remember me?
Who has your allegiance?
I am loyal, to the true heir of Bebbanburg.
Good.
Bear witness all, the true heir of Bebbanburg!
Who are you, boy?
Wihtgar, son of Aelfric.
Very much alive and back at Bebbanburg as flesh and blood.
And I could kill you with this arrow in a heartbeat.
You can try.
The arrow would miss.
Then you know nothing of the weapon of the desert.
Put down the bow.
Put down the bow!
You've lost everything, Osbert!
I won’t tell you again, put down the bow!
A son does not always love a father.
Learn from that, fool.
Now, who’s with me?
Who is with Wihtgar of Bebbanburg?
Get ready!
Get ready to fight!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SEASON: 04
EPISODE: 01
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred... born a Saxon and rightful heir to the great fortress Bebbanburg.
For many years, I fought for King Alfred of Wessex...
... and for his vision of the kingdoms as a single union... England.
But my loyalty was never rewarded.
You are not the best of fathers.
My children were taken from me and my son handed to the Church.
Finally, we made peace... although the reconciliation was brief.
The King is dead and so together we pray for his soul... for his successor Edward.
The new king has much to learn.
Wessex appears to be in a land of chaos and doubt.
God is with us.
However, Alfred's widow, Lady Aelswith, alienates men who were loyal to him.
You were the King’s priest and, as such, you no longer have a role.
And Lord Aethelhelm has ambitions of his own.
Why was I not told that Edward had been married previously?
Aethelflaed's marriage has also not brought harmony.
I want her dead.
She holds a place in my own heart.
Brida's great love Ragnar is dead.
She has made a new alliance with the Dane Earl Cnut.
You should be under furs, woman, with me.
And I want to enjoy all of you, while there's time.
Whilst the warrior Haesten schemes to gain influence.
I also have scores I must settle.
Throughout all my victories, defeats, loves and losses, I have stayed true to my conviction... that I will one day return to Bebbanburg and overthrow the man who will stop at nothing to have me killed... my uncle Aelfric.
Destiny is all.
Bastard Scots! kill them!
Slay them all! Don’t spare a single one of them!
Sons of whores!
They’re weakening. Forward!
We have them! Advance!
Don’t let them escape!
Advance, you cowards! kill them all! Do not let them escape!
What in God’s name...
Retreat!
Retreat to Bebbanburg!
Open the gates!
Open the gates!
Open the gates!
Go! Go!
Open the gates!
How many did we lose this time?
Over half, Lord.
Then we need more men... or it'll be our heads on the ramparts.
Will they go back across the border? They'll gather reinforcements in Scotland, keep attacking till they whittle us down to nothing.
If they take Bebbanburg, they have a gateway south.
They want all of Northumbria.
Lord, where do we bury the dead? Leave them for the scavengers.
On your feet!
The last men standing.
My greatest fighters.
Or the most fearful, the ones who cowed and hid and ran?
The Scots will return!
They want to take our land and see us gone.
So unless you want to end up rotting on a slave ship, I suggest you find the stomach to fight.
To fight!
Or leave!
Go on, leave now!
There is no place for doubt... or weakness.
I will never surrender to invade!
My men can be destroyed! The villages starved!
They can dig a trench a mile wide!
But while I live, these walls will not be breached.
This fortress will not fall!
I will never yield my birthright, nor seek peace with those who attack us.
We fight on, until they are all butchered.
It’s time we're heading south, Osferth.
We fight on for Bebbanburg!
For Bebbanburg!
What?
Outside.
No one knows I'm here.
The people that know will not betray us.
Wait.
Who is there?
It is Aldhelm. Lady Aethelflaed's absence has been noted by her husband.
She should leave here before she is discovered.
Stay with me.
I cannot. Yes, you can.
If Aethelred sends soldiers, we will fight them.
Please, he has tortured you long enough.
I know, but men should not die, so I can love you, Uhtred.
Men have died for less.
Not the ones who serve me.
I will not be the cause of bloodshed.
Aethelred would seek Edward's help. We would be outnumbered.
So, you'd take chastity while your husband is chasing another woman?
We both know that's different.
Do not return to him and be humiliated.
You are more than that.
I know.
And, hopefully, in time, things will change for us.
I will go to Winchester to comfort my mother and come back here as soon as I can.
Your men will return from the north soon.
Lady, you know, I do not speak in envy, but, please.
Your husband would take great pleasure in punishing you for adultery, should you give him the excuse.
He takes great pleasure in punishing me for whatever I do.
So, I must try to live with a little happiness.
Besides, I have good men to protect me.
And I know you do not speak from envy.
Any word from Finan? Nothing, Lord.
Do you want to give up your gods for your life?
Do you want me to show you mercy?
No!
No. Mercy is for Christians. What will you do?
Good boy. If they capture you, you do exactly this.
Hey, careful, Cnut!
It means they like you.
They're good boys, Cnut. You're blessed. Yes.
Come, they’ll have taken down the camp without us.
To the settlements until the winter.
We must hide you away, while the men go to war.
Any of you caught humping a Saxon will be executed on our return.
Go!
Arse-Licker. You are the man they call the Arse-Licker?
I am Eardwulf of Mercia, commander of the King Aethelred's guard.
His latest new commander.
I heard you wormed your way back from a family disgrace.
And that your father lost his lands for humping his horse?
I heard there was a Dane who was willing to betray his kinsfolk for money.
You are steel-eyed for a turd.
Perhaps we are fated to work together, Lord Arse-Licker.
They've been loading ships for three days.
Leaving land they fought so hard for?
It's unlike the Danes to slink away.
Where is Cnut taking his men? Irland.
A cousin Sigtryggr is being held captive by the natives.
That will take at least a winter. Will they come back?
The women are going to local settlements, so, there will be warm tits to return to.
Why do you tell us this?
Because, unlike you, I'm not rewarded for my service.
You should have licked more asses. Perhaps.
And...
I no longer want war.
I'm too old to sleep in the dirt.
I want silver and Lord Aethelred has it?
Makes his own coin?
How ambitious.
How is the weasel? Still a man of wisdom and honor.
Who promotes an ambitious soldier... brave.
Who rewards loyalty.
I hear he takes your sister as his whore. Then you heard wrong, Dane.
She's not a whore and he does not take her.
This is good work. Thank you, my Lord.
There's a boat down river, Lord.
Women of Coccham!
We are back!
They know, Finan. They can smell you from here.
You look like shit.
What have you done to my ship? Now, that was Osferth’s fault.
What news from Bebbanburg? Good news, Lord.
My Uncle Aelfric is dead and you have his balls to prove it?
No, but he is being attacked by the Scots pushing south.
He lost half his men in the most recent assault.
So, Bebbanburg's weakened? For now, yes.
Until he finds more men.
Or is slaughtered by the Scots.
So, we could take it.
With an army... we could take it.
Well, perhaps. It will not be easy.
How many men does he have? Barely 40.
Can he raise a fyrd? Oh, God, no. Local lords think he's...
That he's a turd, yes. And they're right.
We should not delay. No.
Go before he buys more men.
We head to Bebbanburg before the Scots return.
The gods are telling us to strike and take back what is mine.
Now, Lord, it'll take ships and men.
The venture could cost you all your silver.
Finan, if we take Bebbanburg, we'll have all the silver we ever dreamed of.
You will all be rewarded for your service, even you baby monk.
Amen.
How many men remain here? Not enough.
We will ride to Winchester and raise an army.
It's time for Wessex to repay all that I have given.
What are they doing with Father's books?
Lord Aethelhelm wants this room given over to planning our defenses.
Apparently, it has the best light to work by.
Be careful!
That is my husband's Chronicle.
Take it to my quarters.
His legacy, all the learning... is no one to keep a record of our times?
They keep a record... of building fortifications.
See, this one tells us how 20 men can fashion a palisade in under a day.
It is all for our own protection.
Mother, I'm so sorry. Please, do not pity me.
I have a better life than many widows.
And my new rooms are comfortable... if rather near the kitchens.
Every time I return, there is a new insult.
I am not certain I believe it.
Are the men that bring the news to be trusted?
Lord Aethelhelm. My King.
What did you hear?
Well, simply that Cnut is leaving for Irland to help a cousin, Sigtryggr, who's besieged there.
Then it must be true. Danes are known for their kindness and loyalty.
We ignore this news until the scouts confirm it.
Continue to fortify along the border.
When the Danes break the peace, we will be ready.
I will inform the whores.
Quicker than the monks at spreading news.
We are resolved. Every man who can wield an ax should be building defenses.
Mother? What news do you talk of?
Perhaps I could offer the wisdom of experience.
Take comfort that all is well.
Come.
Come and lie with me, Eadith. God wants me to be satisfied.
He gave me this desire, so...
So, I am sure there is a servant girl you could hump.
I've had every servant girl from here to Ceaster. It is you that I want.
And it is me you shall have... when the time is right.
Come on. Do not make me force you, Eadith. You set a man on fire.
Do not be surprised when you get burned.
Yes!
Lord Eardwulf, we were not expecting you until nightfall.
Forgive my intrusion, Lord, and to you, sister, but I bring important news.
Have us brought wine. My Lord.
What is your news, Commander? I met a Danish spy and he revealed that Cnut is taking his warriors from East Anglia and heading to Irland, leaving their women and children in undefended settlements.
Who else knows of this? No one. I paid him well.
Did you see them leave? Yes.
They're dismantling their camp and packing their boats.
A cousin is under attack in Dyflin.
If they're leaving East Anglia, then it's empty and ready for us to conquer it.
And if I enlarge our land, then Mercia no longer has to bow to Wessex and Edward.
Troops can be readied when you want them, but I would suggest that we leave quietly, before the Ealdormen can disapprove. This is an excellent plan.
It appears the relics of St. Oswald are already working in my favor.
I'm collecting all the bones of our beloved Saint... as a good omen to signal to the Mercian people that I shall restore their lands to greatness.
I'm sure they'll be impressed. It's my gift to the common folk.
Monks are leaving imminently with silver to bargain for his heart... and the winds are clearly blowing in our favor.
Thank you for all that you've done. It's impressive.
Anything I do, I do for Mercia.
Indeed.
You could teach your sister a lesson in generosity.
Our game is not finished.
Are you talking horseshit? No. I met a spy and the news is true.
The man is inflated enough without you encouraging him. I'm trying to keep him happy.
As should you. Just hump the desperate bastard.
I hump him and he loses interest.
If we want all this to continue, then we must not overplay our hand.
Do you want to return to being landless and ridiculed?
You hump him, if you do not believe me. I tried. He did not bite.
Will you hurry, Sable!
Ah, the monks.
I'll fetch your silver. You leave for Northumbria immediately.
St. Oswald’s heart? Bloody long way to go for a piece of dried offal.
Still, a few taverns to stop at along the way.
Northumbria’s a piss-hole place to waste a journey on.
Did you meet this Arse-Licker? I did.
Word will spread that you leave for Irland.
And he believed you?
He wants to kiss his master's backside. He believes what he wants to hear.
Then we shall attack Mercia, while their backs are turned.
We sail to the estuary before dawn, head upstream and keep the boats apart to avoid any scouts.
When we reach Mercia, we assault Aegelesburg in two bands and I will kill their little Lord.
Too timid to attack the boy king in Wessex?
The boy king in Wessex has been building defenses.
And the fool in Mercia has been following his cock.
We kill Aethelred, Wessex is honor-bound to come to Mercia's aid.
We lure out Edward from behind his walls... and fight on our terms and take the country.
As so many others have failed to do.
What did you do to tame her?
I treated her with respect and gave her love.
After you slaughtered the man she cared for.
I pity the bitch.
Do not give me a reason to kill you.
My friend.
All right.
Yes.
I hear Uhtred is downstairs. Were you expecting him?
Uhtred? No, not until summer.
Are you sure it's him?
From the reaction of the novices, I'm fairly certain.
Beocca!
Hild!
You have made quite an impression.
And you have not changed.
He has. Are you still writing this great work?
St. Cuthbert is capricious. He eludes me daily.
A master takes his time.
You look like a man with good news. I am.
And we will need to sit for it and we will need wine.
It is indeed worth waiting for.
Aelfric will finally see a reckoning.
Yes, never has a man deserved it more.
He is now weakened and without allies.
Has he no heir to assist him? He did.
A son... but the heir Wihtgar was banished.
He died last summer in the southern sea. You can starve him out.
Surround the fortress.
What was your plan?
My plan is that you join us... both of you.
Oh, I think my fighting days are over, Uhtred.
You, then?
You don't want an old man. Beocca, you're not old.
And you have mourned Thyra long enough. She would not want this sadness for you.
Throw it off and return to Bebbanburg with me.
I cannot.
Without me, the nuns would have no one to minister the sacraments.
And the life of St. Cuthbert will not write itself.
Take the fortress. I will join you, when the hard work is done.
Then we will hold a feast there in your honor.
You deserve to go back, Uhtred.
Yes, to restore your family to their rightful place.
I want to make a home for my children to return to.
Are they well? Your children? Stiorra thrives.
She lives at Aethelflaed's estate.
My son, I do not see. Alfred's influence has made him holy.
What news of Wessex?
Wessex... thrives.
Defenses are being strengthened against the Danes.
Edward's son is now walking.
The King's wife is to be crowned a queen.
It is unusual to honor the girl, whilst the widow Aelswith lives, to say the least.
But Aelflaed has an ambitious father.
Yes, Lord Aethelhelm is ambitious.
But King Edward just accepts this ambition from an Ealdorman?
Let's just say we feel his father's absence.
Finish your prayers. It is nothing of concern.
Walking like a fat man, friend.
It is my massive balls, Uhtred.
Too much palace food and sitting on your backside.
Perhaps. I fight less than I did. There will be fighting yet.
Do you know something we do not, Lord Uhtred?
Lord King. Steapa.
I only know that Danes do not like peace.
Did you hear Cnut is now heading to Irland to rescue a cousin?
No. I heard he has brought his sons over from his homeland, which means he has ambition here.
And what brings you to Winchester?
I'm here to make you an offer.
I can help you fulfill your father's dream of a united land... if you give me men to retake Bebbanburg.
Is Uhtred Ragnarson trying to negotiate?
It is a good idea.
If the bastard Scots are making incursions, they will return in number.
He takes the fortress. It becomes your foothold in Northumbria.
I take Northumbria and I unite the four kingdoms.
Small matter of conquering East Anglia, but that is mainly cattle and people that look like cattle.
Your father knew it could be done, one country, one king.
Since when have you cared for my father's vision, Uhtred?
Since it coincided with what he wants, by the sound of it.
It works for the both of us.
Unless you want the Scots to gain a stronghold to attack you from?
Aelfric cannot hold them off like I can.
I control the fortress. You control the country.
Give me 100 men, it will take a week.
Two hundred, I can take it in a day...
It would certainly fulfill an ambition.
But given the ongoing threat from the Danes here in the south, is it wise to distract ourselves... gallop to the frozen north for what is, in essence, a family feud?
Uhtred has done much to distract the Danes from Wessex.
Yes and we are all very grateful for his service.
But surely his oath was to see the King on the throne.
A duty that is now performed.
What is the point you are making, Lord Aethelhelm?
I'm merely saying that there is no debt on either side.
No debt... Lord Uhtred is free... to take what he wants.
You to defend what you have... which is the innocent people of Wessex from the marauding heathen.
By cowering behind walls and waiting for the Danes to attack?
No, by not being forced to fight before we are certain to win.
There are good reasons to go softly and strategically.
That is how you got where you are, Lord Aethelhelm.
Lord, take this moment your God is offering you.
Your father had a dream...
And my father also knew when to say no to Uhtred Ragnarson.
I am no longer the boy who can be bent to your will.
This is not saying never, but now is not the time.
"Now is not the time."
Years, I've waited. Years, I've given my sword.
Years, my home has been denied to me.
"There's no debt."
Winchester is a snake pit.
We will think of another plan.
Do you think our band can take the 40 men at Bebbanburg?
Two on one? Ask me when I'm drunk. Come on, Finan.
Our men are three times the fighters Aelfric's are.
I know. It's just unbreachable walls and boiling tar that worry me.
Not to mention the Scots waiting to take it for themselves.
Is the plan off, then?
Are we just staying here to get drunk?
The plan is unchanged. We head to Bebbanburg.
Take the fortress, then we get drunk.
Just us... without an army?
You don't need an army to kill one man. We kill Aelfric, the gates will open.
None, Aidan? None, Lord. We have tried.
Offer them three times what a mercenary would normally receive.
I do not think silver will tempt them.
Are they afraid of the Scots? No, but they think that we are doomed.
There is another way, but you will not like it.
We have had word that Aethelred of Mercia is sending monks...
What does that turd want with us?
The heart of St. Oswald.
I know it is a precious relic and that it has been at Bebbanburg for generations, but it may be our only course.
Aidan, I am a devoted Christian, who fears his saints.
Bebbanburg was my reward from God for my constant and unwavering piety.
Yes, indeed.
Send out to whatever hovels the common people live in.
Round up the farmers' sons.
Will that work, Lord? The farmers are not well-disposed to us.
It will work if you hold a knife to the mothers' throats.
Look around you, Eardwulf. Lord?
Soon, all that you see will belong to Mercia.
Cnut's mistake for leaving will be our glory.
It's getting in to Bebbanburg, that's the problem.
I say we just turn up and ram the gate.
Or we just ask nicely to be let in.
Next idea.
We are not dressing up as nuns. I wasn't going to say that.
But you were. No, I wasn't.
Lord Uhtred!
Thank you for offering your men to clear the stab.
What!
Lady Aethelflaed will meet you in the garden.
Do not turn me into a brothel-keeper.
Oh, but you enjoy the savage life. Uhtred!
Do your novices not know that?
Ladders.
Lord Uhtred. Lady Aethelflaed.
Forgive me for not meeting you at the palace.
My woman Sable is at my husband's estate.
And she has learned something that will be very useful to you.
It is all being done very quickly and I am not one to spy or spread rumors.
But Lord Aethelred is collecting the relics of St. Oswald.
Why is this important?
Because, when St. Oswald's body is reunited in Mercia, the land will be returned to greatness.
It is important to our people. Why is it important to me?
Tell him of the monks, Sable. Oh, yes.
All that remains to be gathered is the heart of St. Oswald, which your uncle... Of course.
Aelfric keeps it at Bebbanburg.
It's no doubt some dog liver my ancestors bought.
Nevertheless, a treasure to the Mercians.
Lord Aethelred has sent a pair of monks up north to strike a bargain for it.
Do you know when?
They should reach Grimesby by Sunday, then Bebbanburg on the day of Ascension.
When is Ascension? Ten days before Pentecost.
Two weeks from now.
Intercept these brothers and you could gain entry into the fortress.
I will need a priest who can accompany these monks.
I am sorry, but I can provide nothing more.
I cannot defy my brother.
I hope your brother values your loyalty.
I hope you win what you have longed for.
Uhtred...
What if you die doing this?
Then you will be the last woman to hump Uhtred of Bebbanburg.
Is that your way of promising to be faithful?
Do not answer that.
If we leave now, we should make it to the monastery by nightfall.
We will need another beast, a small one.
Hump the horseman's wife if you have to.
I'd rather hump the horse.
Why the extra horse, Lord? It's for a priest.
Which priest? One I hope will be glad to see me.
Well, well.
Finally back to Bebbanburg.
Beocca... if you want to come, I will carry you there.
Ride with me. We will rest when you need to.
I will fight with you on my shoulders. You do not need me for this, Uhtred.
You're ready to face this alone.
Fulfill your father's birthright.
Restore Northumbria to greatness.
The pride should be on your shoulders and yours alone.
You deserve this.
I will repay all the debt I owe you three times over.
You will live like a lord in Bebbanburg.
You owe me nothing, Uhtred.
Anything I ever did for you, I did from my own heart.
May the Lord bless you and keep you in this adventure.
Thank you, Father.
Goodbye, pure and holy abbess.
Goodbye, you bloodthirsty heathen.
Take this.
Turn it into hack-silver and pay for bribes along the way.
Keep each other out of trouble.
kill them all!
No! No!
Look how he worms his way in, with the King's guard.
Why do that if you do not seek influence?
I do not trust him.
In the past, he has suggested to me things that are most unchristian, in regards to the other heirs to the throne.
Do you mean the firstborn you had banished so your son could make a better marriage?
I mean the children who were conceived without holy union.
The first marriage was legitimate.
There are priests who will swear on the Book to it.
Lady...
you chose Lord Aethelhelm's daughter as a match, because he had silver that Wessex needed.
You chose her over a woman your son loved and who had borne him children.
You cannot invite a serpent into the garden and be surprised when it slithers on the ground.
Did I not have you removed from the court, Father Beocca?
Yes, another one of your rash judgments.
It is unwise to remain somewhere you are not wanted.
And yet you choose to stay here, too.
Perhaps we are not so different.
This bitterness is not her.
Her role is diminished and she is veiled in grief.
Yes.
It can make a person less than they should be.
I should know.
Seize the land to the north until you reach the sea.
And then we will see which Saxon kingdom is the greatest.
And who should kneel to whom.
Which one?
It's not him.
It's him. Go!
Hey! Get off! Who are you! He's a sinner, Father!
Where are we going?
Hello, Father. Men, this is my son. Young Uhtred.
I don't use that name. It belongs to a priest killer.
I'm here to guide you back to your family.
The Church is my family.
It's not. You were placed there without my permission.
Praise be to King Alfred for that.
We are leaving this place and you are coming with me.
Am I? Yes, you have no choice.
Take off the woman's garb. Wear this.
And, uh... I have a gift for you.
Sihtric!
Impressive beast.
Hey. I did not realize how much you'd grown.
Ride to Coccham with us. In time, we will find you a proper horse.
Why would I go to Coccham?
To collect the ship that will take us north... to reclaim your birthright and mine.
To seize back what was lost and unite our family.
I'm taking you to Bebbanburg. Never heard of it.
He doesn't seem to like you much. That's Alfred's legacy.
The man torments me still.
Let me guess. I'm to be banished again.
Would I let that happen, Beocca? I would say keep yourself indoors a while.
I am to be silenced.
I'm sorry. Lady Aelswith wields power where she can.
I will drop in and bring you news until she has calmed herself.
You are a good man, Father Pyrlig.
A good friend to me and to Wessex.
Before you go...
to advise a king is a great honor.
But it can also be a curse.
Sometimes found myself at war with my own conscience.
I want you to know you have my blessing. To do what?
Whatever must be done to protect King Edward.
Ah. The King grows wiser by the day, true.
He has all the makings of a great leader, I'm sure.
But time may be against you.
Those around him have ambition.
And it is not the ambition of the King, or of his father, who we both loved.
So, you do what you must.
It's sturdy enough.
Do we not need something more... agile?
We're not taking pelts to sell to Frankia.
Do you want Aelfric to know that we're coming?
I suppose not.
Pelts it is.
Uhtred!
Beocca?
Are you kidding?
Do you have room for half a man more? I flee the wrath of the Lady Aelswith.
As do we all. I'm sure we can make space for you.
I'm afraid I'll be not much use to you as a fighter.
Happily for you, I am desperate.
We'll require more ale, for sure.
Did Hild send you to keep an eye on me?
No.
It was entirely my decision.
You were right. I've allowed myself to get old too quickly.
I shall leech off their youthfulness... revive myself.
What is the real reason?
Word reached me... of the abduction of a young deacon.
So, I felt I should, uh...
You came to help me be a better father.
Well, there is that.
And?
Come, get on the boat with us.
What use do you have for me?
Why do you drag me to something for which I'm not made?
Because I see the man that you will be, not the boy that you are.
I know what it is to be ripped from one life to live another.
And I know that it will make you stronger.
Perhaps my faith is being tested.
Perhaps that's what it is. You see this?
This was my father's.
One day it will be yours.
It is fate. It doesn't feel like fate.
It feels like penance.
Get your saintly arse on the bench, Osferth.
Let's go. He gets sick traveling backward.
I do not. I just like to see where we’re going.
To Bebbanburg!
Raise the sail!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SEASON: 03
EPISODE: 10
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred.
On the eve of his death, I finally made peace with the great King Alfred.
You are hereby pardoned.
He is gone.
Wessex is in chaos.
Have a messenger return to Mercia.
I'd like the comfort of further hearth-guards.
And his vision of one England is incomplete.
It is the purpose of the witan to choose a king.
Uhtred cannot be allowed to ally himself to Edward.
This is the moment the Danes have long waited for.
But Brida seeks the truth.
Men are saying he killed Ragnar.
Aethelwold? Was it him?
He was in fear of Ragnar.
Then he's mine to kill.
Only with Thyra's blood can we send my brother Ragnar to Valhalla.
You will tell your friend Uhtred his pardon is to be rescinded.
He must leave Winchester or I shall have him taken.
The lady Aelswith has dishonored her husband's wishes and I am imprisoned, at a time when my sister is seen only as a Dane.
Is that not what she is?
An enemy.
In a hole is where you belong.
Destiny is all.
Beocca!
Beocca!
Beocca!
Beocca, my love!
Beocca!
He is with God.
May his soul rest in peace for all eternity. Amen.
fire! Sound the bell. fire!
Fetch the water!
We should meet, Lord. Continue our previous discussion.
For what purpose?
The Danes will hear of Alfred's death and they will attack Mercia.
Mercia will be ready.
To die? Or to thrive?
Find me.
I find him to be lower than a snake's belly.
That does not mean that he is wrong.
We need to stop the fire spreading! Get more water!
For Christ's sake, get more water!
Oh, be-Jesus!
Oh, dear Lord!
Fetch Father Beocca! Fetch him now! Go!
More water!
Thyra? Is she inside?
I thought she was at the palace. No, no, she left. She walked out!
More water!
Father Beocca?
We would like a last moment with the king.
Alone.
Yes, of course.
Lady Aelswith, forgive me.
You're going against the king's wishes.
Father Beocca? You may be needed.
Get the door! Get the door!
Get back! Get back!
No! No, this is not happening!
Thyra!
I'm here! I am here!
Thyra!
Thyra!
Beocca.
Father, she is with God now. You know that.
And he will welcome her, I'm sure.
It's how her family died, in a fire.
You think that would be a comfort? Or would it terrify her further?
Father, all we know is that she's at peace now.
She's at peace.
You need to walk away now, Father. A drink of ale, maybe?
Once the heat has gone, I shall recover her and wrap her for you to bury.
I... No... I will find her. She is my wife.
She is. We'll help you then.
This fire did not just happen. It did not.
These are dark and important days for both Wessex and Mercia.
Just as soon as the Danes hear of Alfred's death...
They will attack, you have said, and we agree.
We will fight. Why? Why fight only to lose?
Who says we must lose?
To have even a chance, Mercia would need Wessex, and Wessex has been left with a pup as its master. You'll lose.
The Danes will march and we will have to fight.
We negotiate. Then let them slaughter Edward and the small number of idiots who choose to follow him.
Small number?
Edward does not have all of Wessex behind him.
Some will follow, but not all.
Wessex will not have great numbers of men.
Lord Sigebriht is about to return to Cent and ready his own considerable guard and fyrd.
To do what? To join the Danes?
Edward is not Alfred and never can be, but...
There'll be no need for swords! I am merely introducing myself.
You will let me go! Not until there is calm.
There is madness. Father Beocca, you are suffering.
I do not wish to hear your voice.
It was you who killed her, not some stray ember on a bed of straw.
I am not to blame for your misfortune...
It was you.
If not directly, then by the words you whisper, by the lies you tell, the bile you spew!
I think we should find another table.
In the eyes of some, a gentle woman became an enemy and nothing more.
You should turn a deaf ear to this man.
Father Beocca, I will forgive this display, just once.
Another word and you will pay.
What have I said? Wessex is splintered. I will have no more of it.
Haesten? What is this?
It is the beginning, my friend.
Alfred, king of the shit-eating Saxons... has breathed his last! The king is dead!
Haesten, and you are certain this time?
Dagfinn? It is true, Lord.
We have heard it many times, from priests and warriors and peasants alike.
They cry in the streets of Winchester.
Then it begins. Hmm.
It begins.
Sharpen your blades! It begins!
Is there to be a trial, or a simple execution?
It was my mother's intention to cut your throat, but she has been persuaded to revert to banishment.
You are to leave Winchester and Wessex and never return.
And what of Edward?
What of the king's letter, his pardon? Does that count for nothing?
Uhtred, you must leave or she will have you killed.
Find Beocca.
I must speak to Beocca. Fetch him, please.
I cannot fetch him.
He has trials enough.
What trials?
I am here.
I have heard what the lady has said, and I am here to beg you, Uhtred, to beg you to stay.
Father Beocca, he cannot stay.
There will be a hearing. Perhaps.
And we shall be heard. We must. What has happened?
Accept a trial and speak out. If you do not, the devil will have won!
Beocca? Do not abandon what you helped to build.
There is a change in you.
Thyra is with God... the gods, even.
How? fire.
Set by good Christian men, no doubt.
Which men?
She is with Gisela now. She is with her mother.
We cannot allow ourselves to be consumed by her death.
All that Alfred stood for is crumbling.
You, Uhtred, cannot be dragged into the shadows.
You must become the light.
My Lady Aethelflaed.
You will inform your brother and your mother that Mercia has a king with his own mind.
I will do nothing of the sort.
Alfred is gone.
Therefore, all agreements made with Alfred no longer stand.
Mercia will remain allied with Wessex.
The two countries will stand together or they will fail.
The two countries are equals.
Each free to choose who to befriend and who to fight.
Who to fight?
Lord Aldhelm, you must remind my husband what it means to be a Mercian.
Lord King, I must say I do not disagree with her.
I need assuring, Lord, that you will not align Mercia with Aethelwold, nor the Danes.
It would be a betrayal.
You need assuring?
We are proud Mercians, Lord. Do you question me?
I am concerned.
Do you doubt me?
I simply wish to understand your thinking.
My guard of 50 men.
Did you send for them?
You will agree they are needed at home.
Did you send for my guard of 50 men?
I did not.
Should you live, Aldhelm, never disobey me again. Never.
Your wound is from an alehouse brawl.
I have been considering my defection to the Danes.
I will hold until the very last moment. Meaning what?
Edward will march and I will promise to join him, but I will arrive late.
As the Danes attack from the front, I will attack from the rear.
My army against a fyrd of peasants.
It'll be a slaughter and my men will survive.
I can almost hear the screams of panic.
Lady, forgive me. I did not know where else to go.
He believes he can negotiate...
or is at least considering the possibility.
The bleeding has stemmed. I hope.
A gut wound is a slow death.
A gut wound can heal. It will heal.
Lady...
you have my heart.
I fear that I love you.
If I can't say it while dying, when will I?
You are not dying.
Lady, you must act, for Mercia. You must.
Call the men to arms and save us.
It's time.
I am to take you to the frontier of Mercia, to witness you leaving Wessex.
Lord? What is this, a hunting party?
I am an outlaw once again. To be banished or executed.
Shall we follow you, Lord?
Leave Winchester for the Danes?
Lord?
Walk.
What is he doing?
He's standing still, Lady.
Uhtred, you will walk and you will get up onto your horse!
I am a free man. I have a letter of pardon.
It bears the king's seal. It is written in the king's hand...
Someone take his tongue.
Does Alfred's word count for nothing, now that he is gone?
And you are a man who once held a knife to the king's throat.
Show us one witness who can say this letter was written willingly.
One witness. There was no witness.
We are gifting you your life! You shall be grateful and you shall leave this land in peace!
There will be no peace, Lady. war is coming.
There is a Dane army marching this very moment.
And I will not abandon the people of Wessex...
Who do you think you are? Steapa!
The entire city is watching. Uhtred speaks the truth.
And you are nothing but smitten. Lady Aelswith!
I cannot let this injustice go unchallenged.
If Uhtred of Bebbanburg claims to have been made a free man by King Alfred himself... we cannot dismiss it so lightly. Only a king can deny a king.
Wessex has no king. Wessex has no king!
We have Edward Rex.
The witan decides who is king.
Edward is the aetheling.
He has no authority. He is Alfred's son and nothing more!
I'm sure the monasteries are full of Alfred's sons.
Do all bastards have a claim to the crown?
Bishop Erkenwald, you will end this display.
King or not, if Edward believes the letter of pardon to be untrue, then I will leave Wessex.
Steapa, you will return the prisoner to the palace.
This is no place for such decisions.
This is precisely the place! Justice must be seen to be done!
Steapa! Unhand the prisoner.
Though he remains a prisoner, I will allow Lord Uhtred to speak. He has earned that right.
Though you have not, Lord, not yet. You have no authority.
Do you object to the people bearing witness to justice, Lord Aethelwold?
I do not.
Uhtred, the king swore that you were to die.
Why the change in his heart?
Because he believed that I deserved his forgiveness.
Is that a boast?
Look to his chronicle. I am on every page.
That is a lie. You are not named, even once!
But I am there. Unwritten, Lady, but I am there!
The warriors of Wessex know it.
The Danes know it.
And it is what the king has told me himself.
I have heard enough.
I am with him from the Somerset Marshes to Ethandun and all of the battles that have followed.
We were bonded, him and I.
He was the man that I could never be, nor did I wish to be.
He was a man that I loved and despised...
but it was never less than an honor to serve him.
He was my king.
And he did not wish to go to his God without granting me what I have earned many times over!
My freedom.
But the question remains:
Why did he choose not to announce it?
You will remember my great friend Leofric, a warrior and a Saxon to the bone!
He told me once that I could never better Alfred.
"Because the bastard thinks," he said.
Perhaps your father chose not to announce my freedom for this very reason... so that the people could witness their new king, Edward, dispensing justice.
Fairly, I hope.
Will you accept the decision of Edward Rex?
I will. I give you my word.
Lord... Again, I say, and with respect, the boy does not have the power to make such a statement.
He is an aetheling and nothing more.
He is no more an heir to the crown than myself.
Lord, the decision is yours to make.
My father, King Alfred, demanded loyalty, unity.
He believed in his god and doubted those who did not.
A heathen would not be trusted completely until he had embraced Alfred's god as his own.
And yet...
it was a heathen he did trust most.
It was the word of Uhtred that he respected most.
Uhtred of Bebbanburg, I find the letter written by my father to be true.
Alfred's pardon does stand.
You are a free man, able to choose your own path.
May I ask, Lord Uhtred, may I ask?
Now that you are a free man once more, where will your path lead?
I would like to know.
Steapa, my sword.
One day, Father, I hope that my path will eventually lead north to Bebbanburg, but now, I believe I am needed here.
I will follow Edward Rex!
Cnut, swear to the gods that it was Aethelwold who killed Ragnar.
It was. I swear.
He must not fall in battle.
If you wish to see Ragnar in the hall of the slain, then Aethelwold must not just fall to any sword.
I do not understand. Keep him safe until I'm ready.
Do it for me and for Ragnar.
I will. I will keep him safe.
We fight for Ragnar!
And for every Dane that has ever fallen to a Saxon sword!
If the Danes are moving through East Anglia and towards eastern Mercia, then that land is Danelaw.
Their army can only grow.
As before, we must march out to meet them.
I've spies inside Danelaw.
They confirmed they are moving closer.
I have issued an order for my men at the frontier to retreat.
Retreat?
It is good sense, Lord. Every warrior must be made to count.
But how far do I retreat?
Where and when does Mercia make a stand?
Where and when will we be joined by Wessex?
That is to be decided.
I would like to know.
Because Wessex appears to be in a land of chaos and doubt.
Does each of the handful of ealdormen here stand with Edward?
We do. Of course we do.
He is to be king.
Lord Sigebriht?
We do.
And what of those who are not here?
Those who hurried back to their halls, despite knowing there is talk of war?
They are with us Lord Aethelred!
Wessex will not have great numbers, I am hearing.
We shall be marching to fight, Lord. Lord King...
Do not believe there is another option.
Haesten and Cnut are men without honor.
They will take your land, your silver and the tin crown from your head.
All of you, hear me.
Yes, it is likely that the Danes will have greater numbers, but this is a battle that we can win.
Though it will take all of us, every man and every sword, and we will fight with all the guile and wit that Alfred has instilled.
God is with us.
I shall return to Mercia.
Send word of your intentions, and soon, but, I warn you, I will not fight a battle that cannot be won.
I won't send my subjects into a slaughter.
Do you wish to become a puppet, Lord Aethelred?
Send word.
Lord.
He's right.
I am not my father.
When Winchester fell to Guthrum, your father hid himself away in the marshes, for months.
He hid in fear for his life and of failure, but he overcame that fear.
We will find the words and you will write letters to each and every ealdorman and thegn of Wessex and they will answer your call. They will come.
To where?
Lord, if we have fewer men, the very last place we want to fight is open ground.
Bedanford.
Bedanford is a good distance away.
That is the path they would take.
It is a long march, Lord, but the land could be to our advantage.
It could, Lord.
Bedanford it must be.
Then I will do it.
With your help, I will find the words.
The devil cannot win.
The devil will not win.
I will need a sword, or an ax. A shield.
This is a battle I will not watch.
I need to fight, Uhtred, till I can fight no more.
Lord Sigebriht.
You are leaving in the night? There is an army to raise.
You have been sitting with Aethelwold for some time.
If you are questioning my loyalty, do not.
I am Wessex, as was my father and my grandfather.
But you are not for Edward.
That does not make me a traitor to my country.
Then you will be there, in battle? I will.
Wessex will need the men of Cent.
A letter will soon find you.
We will be there. For the good of Cent, and for Wessex.
Yes, for Wessex, Lord Sigebriht.
You are one day Saxon, the very next day Dane, Uhtred.
I have not yet offered you my condolences for Ragnar.
Your brother deserved a warrior's death.
I am sorry you will not see him in Valhalla.
This is where you belong, Aethelwold.
Winchester?
Standing on a stab floor like a horse's turd.
Will you be riding for Edward?
I will be there and I will be praying for a great victory.
For Saxon or for Dane? Do you care? You belong to neither.
I did once fear you, Uhtred, but now I see you are nothing but a sword. A lump of metal.
Yes, you have reputation, but that will fade.
And you will die forgotten and unwritten.
You will go neither to Heaven nor to Valhalla.
This letter from Edward, it had better be good.
A letter has been sent.
It speaks out to every man in the kingdom, demanding that he answers the call and joins us on the road to battle.
It says that this will be a battle that will be spoken of for lifetimes to come.
It is a battle that no man can ignore, no man can stand by and watch.
Every man must find a weapon and every man must fight!
Wessex will always be the light.
And no matter how heavy our swords become, we must fight.
Fight! Fight and keep on fighting until the victory is ours!
We march!
Aethelwold is not with us.
I wondered why the stench had gone.
No doubt he's making his way to the Danes.
He may know of Bedanford. He will tell them.
Which is why we're heading towards the woods. Beyond Bedanford.
We are?
We assemble at Bedanford as requested, in the letter, but then we march on to attack the Danes in the woodlands.
A small advantage for our smaller numbers.
You have the blood kept safe?
I do, Lord. Always. And it is blessed.
Thyra's blood?
Yes.
And it will save Ragnar's soul?
It will take him from Niflheim to Valhalla, yes.
From Hell into Heaven.
I must kill the man who killed Ragnar, with a blade marked with Ragnar's blood.
Thyra's blood.
It is the same.
Who is this man you will kill?
I do not know.
So Uhtred lives?
Now rides with Edward? Yes.
You were supposed to kill him.
And I did not.
Could you not find him sleeping?
It barely matters because Wessex is broken.
Half the ealdormen will not answer Edward's call and in one that will, we have an ally.
Sigebriht of Cent.
He commands one of the greatest armies of Wessex and he is with us.
He is? Then he will join us when?
He will join us in battle.
My plan is that he will arrive to attack the Saxons from the rear, once battle has begun.
Good.
Jackdaw? What?
Cnut will be sending out spies in search of the Saxon camp.
You will follow.
I will?
You will find Uhtred and give him a message.
Still no word from Lord Sigebriht.
I'd hoped some men would be here already.
They will come not.
We must continue on to the woodland and begin the fight.
We cannot allow them into open ground.
Then this may well be the place we die, Uhtred.
Or it may well be the place you become king, Lord.
A great king, like your father at Ethandun.
There is nothing more useless than a dead spy.
Finan?
Jackdaw?
He says he has a message, Lord.
I do, Lord. It's from Brida.
Say it.
Am I to be spared?
Yes, you will be spared, but you will not be returning to the Danes.
Say your message.
She says, "Aethelwold," Lord.
She says, "Do not fail."
How long before they come?
They are near.
You are facing death, for certain.
You are wrong, Jackdaw. I will not die.
Osferth!
The blood.
Today, I ask you not to fight for Alfred.
I ask you not to fight for Edward, nor the crown.
But to fight for yourselves. And your forefathers!
They are buried in the soil of Wessex and Mercia, and they have become the soil.
They are the land. And even as I speak... it is for them we are fighting!
They're attacking the rear! Defend the line! Move!
Everyone! attack! attack!
Move! Now!
kill every shit-eating Saxon bastard!
Uhtred, there's too many of the bastards!
Keep your ground!
Where are the Mercians?
Uhtred, the line is breaking!
Push back!
Where is Sigebriht?
Lord! Horses!
Horses!
It is Aethelflaed! It is Mercia!
They are holding firm! Aethelwold! When will your man attack?
Soon! When they are tired! Very soon!
There! There! There he is! Did I not say?
What position is he taking?
For our forefathers!
And for Wessex!
Is he joining our line?
That is your man!
That is your man. And he's fighting for Edward!
He has betrayed us! We still have the numbers!
That is your man!
Push! With me!
Fight! Stand your ground and fight!
We have been betrayed.
They are possessed by devils!
It is lost.
Uhtred, please.
My arm is broken.
I have no way of wielding a sword.
You have another arm.
Please. I will go north, east or west.
I will go to Frankia. To Ireland, even...
You killed Ragnar.
No. No, I didn't. I couldn't. You killed him.
Never. Admit your guilt.
I am guilty of nothing more than wanting what is rightly mine.
Admit it. We are the same, our kingdoms stolen.
You killed my brother! Admit it to me!
Yes.
Or he would have killed me. It was a war of sorts between us.
I am not worth it.
I swear you will never see me again. I will go anywhere, travel as far away as you wish.
Please.
Please.
Please, please.
Uhtred... Uhtred, please.
You will need silver to travel.
A ship's fare.
Yes.
I would.
Not much.
You will never see this face again.
You will go to Hell.
Uhtred?
Look, a bridge.
He's crossing to Valhalla.
He's free.
It will be written in the Saxon chronicle that Edward did gain a great victory over the Danes, ensuring he would become King of Wessex.
But other battles lie ahead, both with the Danes and within Wessex itself.
A king must decide who he can trust and who he must discard.
He must understand the minds of both his enemies and his friends.
He must recognize that the truth of a man lies not in the land of his birth, but in his heart.
A king must be a king on his own terms.
He cannot be his father. He can only be himself.
The chronicle will grow. Pages will be added.
But Uhtred of Bebbanburg will not be mentioned.
Although I, too, was victorious.
My name is Uhtred, son of Uhtred.
My name is Uhtred Ragnarson.
Destiny is all.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SEASON: 03
EPISODE: 07
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred.
Aethelwold has made a pact with the Danes in the hope of succeeding the ailing Alfred.
I can be the bridge between Saxon and Dane.
Return to Winchester. Alfred would kill me.
Aethelwold is there with the Danes? He is.
 Haesten has taken the sorceress, Skade.
But she continues to hold power over her former lord, Bloodhair.
I too have been captured by her spell.
She has cursed you all, and Uhtred allows it.
I will return and if you are here still, then I will kill you.
 I no longer have the trust of my men.
Uhtred is cursed and has lost his mind. Are you with me or not, Dagfinn?
 And even Sihtric has deserted me.
And you are cursed once more, Uhtred of Bebbanburg, you shall wither.
 After the inglorious death... of my brother, Ragnar, his spirit has been banished to Niflheim.
So, with Brida I sought out the seer, Storri, to find a way to free him.
And now we must send him to his rightful resting place: Valhalla.
You must kill the man who killed Ragnar.
 Destiny is all.
Oh! 
 I need ale, slave.  Here.
 What is it?  You mean, "who is it?"
Osferth.
You're back. I'm back.
  That's good.
 I'm back.
Sihtric? Uh, gone.
Long gone and, um, with the prisoners, Lord.
 Good journey, then?  It was.
I know what I must do now.
Osferth. Lord.
You're still alive? Of course.
Reaching Skade will be near impossible.
She's in the middle of 2,000 Danes or more.
It can be done.  How?
With God's help.
I'm joking. I've yet to decide.
When? As soon as I am rested.
When you're rested, you will walk with me.
That is a command.
 Uhtred.
Sihtric's departure... Betrayal.
It has disturbed the men.
They feel that you are to share the blame.
You and your quest for Skade.
Some may not want to go looking for her all over again.
Think on it.
 I am provisioning your men as you asked.
You can ride in a day or less.
 I thought you would ask me to stay longer.
No argument?
 Do you want an argument? I do not.
My husband has written. He'll visit soon.
Urgent matters, it seems.
Then I will stay until he has gone. No.
Your presence will make things worse.
Worse than him wanting to kill you?
I will not hide.
This is my estate and I am wise to him now.
Uhtred?
 Stop, stop. Listen.
He's gone. Like smoke.
You know how to use it?
"Pointy end forward," as Pyrlig would say.
We should divide.
We divide. Pointy end forward.
There! shoot, there!
I know you. I know your face.
It is a common enough face.
You're of Winchester.
Ask me anything and I will give you the truth. I swear.
Brave man.
I am no fool.  You were at Dunholm.
You're Aethelwold's man.
I am, Lord.
He sent you here to do what?
To... kill you, Lord.
And I am glad to have failed.
 Miserably. I am glad!
I would like to see my wife and children once again. Is that so wrong?
When we left Winchester, I did not know we were going to the Danes.
Why did Aethelwold send men to kill Lord Uhtred?
Because Uhtred is Alfred's sword and shield.
Have mercy, Lady. I had no choice.
Offa, you will carry a message to the Danes and I will let you live.
Lord.
Your family in Winchester will be my hostages should you be tempted to lose your way. No, Lord.
 Yes, Lord. What is the message, Lord?
You will to return to Aethelwold and to Haesten, Cnut and Bloodhair.
You will tell them that Uhtred of Bebbanburg is coming, as a shadow walker, and they will die as my brother died.
I will send them all to Niflheim.
I can do that, Lord. I swear.
You will do that.
Like Sihtric, some of you may doubt me.
I understand why.
There have been times when I've doubted myself.
Those times are behind me now.
I am a lord without wealth, without land.
I can't offer silver or the walls of a fortress behind which you can grow fat and lazy.
Follow me and I will take you down a hard, brutal path.
But it is a path that leads to the one thing every true warrior desires: reputation.
Follow me and you will have my sword and my oath.
For whether you are Dane or Saxon, I swear I will die to protect each and every one of you.
My mind is clear about what must be done, but I cannot do it without you.
What now?
I'm sure whatever it is, it will not be the end of me.
It is Aethelwold, Lord. He has returned.
Father Pyrlig, I wish to speak to the king.
I wish to speak to him. I will not stop asking!
Father Beocca then. He's occupied.
Then any member of the witan! Edward, even!
They say he is about to marry.  You'll be dead by then, Lord.
Then I make my plea to you. I am misunderstood!
Your time would be better spent in prayer.
Alfred is in danger from those who would do harm to Wessex.
Men like yourself?
If I would mean to the Alfred harm, then why have I returned alone?
Without a sword!
 I tossed it away at the gate!
Without a hope!
 Why warn the Danes that we're coming?
 Who asks? The men or you?
 I'm asking, but the men would like to know.
 To worry them. They know I am coming, but they do not know when.
It will give them sleepless nights, and when they do sleep, I want them to dream of a cold, cold hell.
 Hell is a place of fire, Lord.
Uh, what are you doing?
Did you believe you were leaving without me? Not a chance.
 What do you want of me?
There are things I would know.
This undertaking, Wessex...
When the signs are favorable and we eventually attack, which one of us Danes will earn glory?
You saw the death of Alfred.
You said it was me who took him from his horse and took an ax to his heart.
I drank with you, more than once.
Then you left me to be passed from man to man like a drinking cup.
Each of you is as unworthy as the next.
Haesten wants you only to hump. He doesn't believe in your power.
You abandoned me. Your path has changed.
Yes, I failed you once. I would not do it again.
Haesten cannot match me, in strength or in spirit.
And yet, I am his.
He cannot make you a queen. Only I can defeat Alfred.
Alfred is now destined to die in his bed.
Only I can defeat Uhtred.
You know it to be true.
I have never lied to you, Sigurd.
What you wish for and who you wish for...
It can never be real while Haesten is alive.
You must kill him.
You like to look?
Why is she eating with us?
Because Bloodhair likes to look and that is all he can do.
She's trouble.
You wish me dead?
That would benefit whom?
Each of us. All of us.
Including Uhtred. Did he ride you so well that you now speak for him?
 You bore me, witch.
Sihtric, answer me this: does Uhtred wish me dead?
He is undecided. He does not know if he should hump you or kill you.
 He's afraid of you. Because she's poison.
She has you all by the balls. Believe it.
Is Brida your woman or not? Soon.
I'm the reason she has returned.
Soon? Her men will be my men.
Tell her to hold her tongue.
You should tell her about your wife, across the sea.
You betrayed Uhtred. Why?
He's losing men and losing his mind.
Will he come for my woman?
He is afraid of the curse. He wants it gone.
Yes, he will come, I'm certain. But he is not the warrior he once was.
Maybe he's more dangerous now.
More reckless, Lord. Unable to plan. That is why I'm here.
 I've given you time enough, I think.
To sit at a graveside, to roam the land.
When? When what?
When will your men become our men?
A union will make us greater than Haesten and Bloodhair.
That's no achievement. They're led by their cocks.
They only think of Skade.
Whereas I think of nothing but Brida.
Let them dream of the seer. Let them turn on each other.
A split may be to our advantage.
And so I ask...
when?
Tonight.
Now.
Edward, be sure not to fidget.
There's no need to fret. Your standing has never been greater.
Mother, I'm not fretting. I'm hoping she is fair.
I'm sure Aelflaed will prove a fitting match.
Stand upright.
Lord King. Lady.
Ealdorman Aethelhelm, Edward you've met.
I have.
May I present my daughter, Aelflaed.
Are the couple to remain during negotiations, or should they retire to another room? Under supervision, of course.
 An excellent idea, Lord.
Edward, perhaps you could show the Lady Aelflaed the courtyard.
A peaceful place.
I suggest we get down to the haggling.
May I sit? Yes, of course.
I do enjoy a haggle.
You have no reason to be afraid of the palace or Winchester.
It is my hope that we can find a happiness.
I will give you no reason to fear me, if fear is the reason for your silence.
I'm not afraid, Lord.
But words are a torment at times.
I do not wish to say something foolish.
I'm sure you will not.
My father fears it.
He said so again and again, all the way from Wiltunscir.
Or perhaps I should not have said that?
I think your father and my mother both could learn about the value of silence.
I worry, too. About words.
I cannot be sure if mine carry weight. Not yet.
When I am king, I must choose them with care.
I would be in good company with a wife who does the same.
Forgive my candor, Lord, but to me, the bride price you offer for my daughter seems low.
As does Edward's morning gift to her.
I believe both offers generous silver. She is to wed a future king.
The morning gift is her protection against dangers that lie ahead.
Those we know and those that have yet to reveal themselves.
I mean no insult to you when I say, Edward is not you.
He is not yet king.
That is the witan's decision.
He proved himself at Beamfleot and none would say otherwise.
I do not doubt it.
He led as a king would. His choices were his own.
 Nevertheless.
The time when power passes from an elder to a younger king is fraught with danger.
Things may change for Wessex.
Speak plainly.
I thought I had, Lord.
Others lay claim to your throne.
Your nephew, Aethelwold, is one.
Aethelwold is imprisoned and will be dealt with.
Edward will be king.
But there is risk, Lord.
That is my point.
What of my daughter's safety then?
The wedding gifts should fit the risk.
Aethelwold is no threat to Edward.
He is a traitor, and will be punished with the utmost severity.
Aelflaed is in no danger, but I understand your deep love for your daughter.
As a mark of goodwill, I will raise the bride price by a third.
That is near enough silver to pave Wiltunscir, is it not?
Thank you, Lord.
 Message from Mercia.
 What's this? A message from the Dane-slayer.
Uhtred sent you?
He did, Lady.
And his message is what?
He says he will come for you, Lord.
For all of you.
In the night, as a shadow walker.
He says you will die, as Ragnar died.
He says... he will send you all to Niflheim.
I say, let him come. Yes.
Feed his guts to Odin's ravens.
I'll make a sacrifice of the Saxon bastard.
You should have done that at Fearnham.
I hear a rat's wheeze.
I said, if you wished to make a sacrifice of Uhtred, you should have done it at Fearnham. But you chose to run.
Haesten, no.
Mind how you speak.
Oh, you fled, did you not? Ran away.
 Bloodhair, say nothing. I lost men in battle.
You lost men in a fortress.
Though I managed to keep hold of my woman.
 Shut your mouth.
 Shall I show you how I bed her?
Shut your mouth!
 Come on. Come on, Bloodhair. I'll be gentle.
Come to Haesten, and I will whelp some pups on you.
We make this square, you and I. Bloodhair, no! Enough of this.
Do you want me to hump you in the square, Bloodhair?
We fight! We fight now! If that is what you want, then yes!
 Fight me! Haesten! No more!
I'll cut your heart out! Prepare!
I'm ready!
I'm ready.
Let make square, then.
I'm noticing this village is different to the others we've passed.
It prospers.
 In the heart of Danelaw, it prospers.
I have a thirst, my friends.
 Everyone here is as fat as a buttered bishop.
A buttered bishop? A buttered bishop.
Do you have a problem with that?
 You!
Who are you?
Who are you?
I am Guthlac, thegn of this place.
I am Uhtred of Bebbanburg.
Never heard of it.
We serve the Lady Aethelflaed. And thus, Mercia. As do you, no doubt.
We are Mercians, yes. Fat Mercians.
What is it you want? Food and ale.
A place to sleep, rest a while.
I'd hope that our beds will be warmer than your welcome.
No swords.
Leave your weapon with your horses. My doors will be open to you.
I will not give you my sword, but you have my word.
We're here for food, ale and rest, nothing else.
Very well, but be warned, we don't take kindly to...
Strangers with swords?  Yes, that.
And now he will send a messenger to the Danes, which could be to our advantage.
 This is fine land I gifted my wife.
One day, I should like to take it back.
With her buried underneath it.
You are to make her like you, Aldhelm.
To what end, Lord?
Hump her, if you wish. 
To what end, Lord?
Bed her and then I shall divorce her.
You are to become my spy.
Your proposal is unacceptable.
Nevertheless, 30 men will be sent here to guard you.
Your men.
Outlaws did enter your estate, my dear.
An attempt was made on your life.
Do you want to be absolved of your responsibilities for my safety in writing?
My guard is adequate.
Where's your daughter?
The half Dane?
Your daughter is not half Dane. She looks like a Dane.
Do we amuse you, Aldhelm?
Well, I was briefly thinking, Lord, that you, too, look like a Dane.
This food is intolerable.
I have to vomit.
Do not rile him, Lady.
He is more dangerous than you know.
I am to make you like me.
Should I sing you a song?  Another time, perhaps.
I admire you, Lady.
More than that, even.
Accept Aethelred's offer of men, half the number.
I will choose them myself, and they will be loyal to you alone. I swear.
I am beginning to believe you are a good man, Lord Aldhelm.
Not quite, Lady.
It's warm still.
Does he know you're here?
It does not matter.
You know me.
You believe in me.
All I want...
is your victory.
You must win me.
You will be mine once again.
He's slow on his feet. He cannot win.
He must not win. He will not win, I swear.
He cannot win. Never.
I must go.
I must go.
Come on!
 It is to the death.
 Valhalla awaits one man.
Are you ready? 
 Then... begin. 
Oh!
Who do you wish to see win?
I am destined for neither.
 Come on, Bloodhair! 
Come.
Come.
Come to Haesten!
She is poison to all men.
 We will bury him.
As a warrior.
He is feasting in the great halls with our fathers!
Bury him.
 Stay together.
I had more fun at the burying of my father.
You knew your father? I knew his fist.
 They are here.
I see you watching.
 Round the back.
Tell our visitor, Uhtred, he is surrounded.
Men with weapon, Lord. Some with bows.
He has sent his messenger. Now he plans to keep us here.
Inside an alehouse? I can think of worse places.
Guthlac belongs to the Danes. They will hear we're trapped and will ride to kill us.
Which is good. There will be less men at their camp.
We are a distraction. And we are surrounded.
Watch that door.  Lord.
Osferth.
Uhtred, I wish only to talk.
Then talk. I do not wish to fight.
 That is a shame. Nothing finishes an evening in an alehouse so well as a fight. Uh, maybe a woman?
 Maybe a woman.
You are outnumbered. There is no way out, and we have bows.
You should yield.
Yield and your men will live. They only want Uhtred.
You're a traitor, Guthlac.
 You cannot escape! I say it again. We only want Uhtred.
You are all free men, free to choose.
 We're with you, Lord.
Bar the door.
Ladies.
We cannot climb out, Lord. The bowmen will have us.
Throw me that ax.
 What now, Lord?
 Bring me fire. Quickly.
He just loves burning things. He'd love hell.
 Finan.
 fire!
The roof!
Get water! Save the place!
Stand! Come on! Stand with me!
  Cowards!
More.  More?
We shall burn the village if we must. Lord.
Save the alehouse!
Spare me, Lord. Spare me.
The Danes made me comply. I had no choice.
Never forget!
 You serve the Lady of Mercia.
First and last.
 Haesten! Haesten!
Uhtred is near.
So he comes for us.
And he is trapped by the thegn of a village upriver.
I would say we should kill him together, but one of us must remain here.
Then, he is yours to kill, my friend.
Go and make your reputation.
We have a Dane-slayer to kill.
 The witan has gathered and will hear your plea, Lord.
That is what you wanted.
 I'm glad to be home, Lord King.
I hadn't expected this welcome...
Aethelwold, you are accused of conspiring with the Danes to ride against Wessex and Mercia.
I understand that is how it appears, but that is not the truth of the matter.
Father Beocca.
When I traveled to Ragnar Ragnarson's fortress at Dunholm, it was Aethelwold himself who welcomed me.
I was pleased to see you, Father Beocca.
He rested easy in the company of Danes, even as they made plans to take Wessex.
Though I was in fear of my life.
In East Anglia, he was seen with the Danes Sigurd Bloodhair and Haesten.
And Cnut.
You. You have made an agreement with these Danes to seat yourself on this very throne as their puppet.
 
What do you say?
Lord, I was among the Danes and do not deny it.
But the story is not as Father Beocca tells it.
You are fond of stories. What would you have us believe this time?
Lord, through your guidance, I have grown into a man.
I served you well in battle, did I not?
I went to spy on the Danes, to bring their secrets to Wessex.
 We will hear him!
I journeyed to Dunholm, told the Danes lies to make them believe I had turned on you, Lord.
They brought me into their trust and revealed their plans.
Uhtred was there.
In truth, it is Uhtred who has betrayed us.
My own sin was vanity, not treachery.
Uhtred did return to Mercia.
He served us well once again at Beamfleot.
We are here to discuss Aethelwold's misdeeds, not Uhtred's.
I cannot say during my time with the Danes, I was never tempted by the apple that was offered.
But I realized as I watched them, that they are... heathen.
The things they did, they have unnatural tastes.
Hair.
I could never give myself over to them and came to warn you, Lord.
Advise, you even. 
 I have come to stand beside you.
And they allowed you to simply walk out of their camp with no resistance?
Uh, I do not know you, but I was not allowed to walk from their camp, not quite.
I told them I'd kill Uhtred.
They fear him, as they should.
He is a danger to us all.
If you did go to spy on the Danes, why didn't you inform the king of your intentions?
Lord, who knows what secrets may have slipped from his tongue?
He must be tried. And he must be executed.
What secrets of the Danes do you claim to have discovered?
They await your death, Lord.
They wish to exploit the chaos thereafter.
I wish to swear allegiance... to the aetheling, Edward.
The king wishes to pray on this matter.
I wish you'd remained with the Danes.
He speaks to you, Lord King?
 I have asked but found no answer.
 The witan is waiting.
I should have done more to stop him straying.
You did all you could, Lord.
What could anyone do for a creature like Aethelwold? He lacks purpose.
I should have provided purpose.
It seems he has found it himself.
He is weak. Accept it.
He stinks of vice. He was rotten from the moment he entered the world.
Aethelwold's failings were born from my own.
Yet it falls to me to exact judgment on him.
No man could have been more forgiving than you.
Not even his own father.
My brother, who I loved.
Who am I to take his son's life?
Wickedness must be repaid.
Perhaps God should judge his servant Aethelwold.
He cannot live, Lord. Men will think you weak...
So I must take my nephew's life to prove otherwise?
And to step from the Christian path of mercy this close to the end?
Might I find the gates of heaven closed to me?
Never, Lord.
Aethelwold is a man who believes himself to be king.
He is a danger to Edward... to your own son.
Cnut and only Cnut.
That's good enough. Less men at the camp.
Sigebriht, thank you.
May I ask... how is the girl you once loved?
Ecgwynn, is it? It is.
She is confined to a nunnery.
 And Edward weds another without a care, it appears.
I would understand it entirely if you could not serve him.
But do men like you and me have a choice?
  The king.
Come forward.
Aethelwold... I am glad that you have come home.
I have no other, Lord.
I have decided, in part, to accept your word.
Thank you, Lord.
What you say is true. The Danes are not like us, not yet.
We live by God's laws.
And he has bestowed on us uncountable blessings and untold mercies.
Wessex is a sacred place... a place of home and harvest... of fairness...
and pity.
All that we love... all that we have built is here.
This land which holds the promise of England.
That is what you have put in danger.
For turning an eye to the Danes, the punishment... is blinding.
Lord, you cannot mean it.
 Lord, you cannot mean it. Lord King...
To see is to be wise.
A king sees with both eyes.
Aethelwold should lose both, but I will be merciful. Only one eye will be taken.
Aethelwold may use the other to find the path to redemption.
No!
Lord, please.
I have repented. I'm at your mercy.
I have confessed my sins. Please, Lord. Uncle...
Steapa. Please.
No, no, no, no. No, Lord!
No, please, no! No, no, wait! Wait, wait, wait, please!
Please! No!
Once night falls, even the king of shadow walkers would find no place here.
 Someone's coming.
 It is Sihtric.
You have something to say to me?
I do.
Yield to me.
You were playing us. My goodness, they were playing us, Finan!
Why? 
If you had not believed it, nor would others.
 I fooled you. No, I knew.
No, you did not. Was I good?
 A little.
I'm telling you, I knew. 
 I hope it was worth it.
 I hope so, too. What do you know?
We saw Cnut on the road.
Only Haesten is at the camp.
Bloodhair?
dead.
He fought with Haesten and was killed by Skade.
Good Jesus.
She's a witch like no other.
She knows I'm near?
She knows of your promise to shadow-walk, but there are too many guards.
She is allowed to collect grass and herbs by a tree for her spells.
A tree? It's a single tree on the other side of the camp. You cannot miss it.
Tell her I'm here and take her there tonight.
And if she refuses? If Haesten prevents her?
She will not refuse and Haesten will not refuse her.
You have never failed me, Sihtric. I will see you at the tree.
Let's go. Finan.
 I knew you'd come for me, Lord.
I'm ready.
I am ready. I'm ready.
 Skade!
Can you hear me? It is Haesten!
kill him for me. Not now. Run!
He is here, Lord! Uhtred is here!
With me! Now!
 Uhtred, run!  There are ships on the river!
 To the river. Sihtric, you lead.
Move!
 We are under attack!
Haesten says to ready the ships!
Now! Untie them now!
 Come on!
Sihtric, the boat!
Make sure it doesn't list, lads!
Prepare the oars!
Ready the oars!
Steady the oars!
And pull! Pull!
And pull!
 Archers, quickly!  Pull!
Pull like a darn slave!
Pull!
 Pull! And pull!
Pull!
And pull!
And pull!

SEASON: 02
EPISODE: 08
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred.
 Sigefrid and Eriks' army raided our camp and kidnapped the Lady Aethelflaed.
 You took my daughter into battle.
 To learn her fate, I sent my loyal men Rypere and Sihtric to Beamfleot as spies.
 I swear that this prize will not be sold cheaply.
 
 Wessex shall pay its share of silver and if necessary its share of blood!
 I will do what needs to be done.
 What is your opinion on paying a ransom for Aethelflaed?
 Not one I am prepared to say aloud.
 I may need you.
 Alfred sent us to negotiate the ransom, but secretly Aethelflaed and Erik have fallen in love.
 Your husband is a fortunate man.
 He is not the man I would choose to be with.
 I cannot let her go.
 I will leave this place with Erik or I will not leave at all.
 Will you help me?
 Please?
 Destiny is all.
 What binds a man to a land?
 You have a poor wretch, toiling in the fields, burning in summer, shivering in winter.
 He works all day, every day for nothing more than a loaf of bread and a pot to piss in.
 His children die of disease, his wife dies giving him children.
 Yet, when that land is threat, something stirs.
 Why?
 It is the land that feeds him.
 More than that.
 Er, the trees off the land are used for shelter and fire.
 More than that.
 Is it love, Father?
 Oh, for the Lord's sake, can you not remain quiet?
 But, yes, the bastard has it, it can only be love.
 It is a powerful thing.
 Would you not agree, Lord Uhtred?
 From wretch to warrior, love gives a man strength often at the cost of his mind.
 How much?
 It's not a small amount, Lord.
 3,000 lbs weight of silver and 500 lbs weight of gold.
 The first of the metal is to be delivered by the next full moon, the remaining amount one month later.
 That is an impossible amount.
 An absurd amount.
 That is the best price?
 It is, Lord.
 It is less than half their first demand, Lord.
 What it is is the entire wealth of Wessex.
 What it would buy is an army to ensure the end of Wessex and Mercia.
 Without the money what will happen to my daughter?
 She is too valuable to simply kill, Lord, it would be humiliation.
 She will be taken to every town where Danes rule, she will be paraded before mocking crowds and men would pay to take their turn.
 It is not just the life and reputation of my daughter at stake here, it is the dignity of Wessex.
 So, many thousands of men must die, Lord, for the dignity of Wessex?
 Yes, 0dda.
 A country is its history, the sum of all its stories 
 we are what our fathers made us.
 Would you have me leave my descendants the shameful tale of how a Princess of Wessex was whored to the highest bidder?
 That is a tale that would overshadow all others.
 The battle of Ethandun would become insignificant.
 But, Lord, if we pay this ransom I do not see how there will be a Wessex.
 The tale they tell will be of the king who paid for the very army that destroyed him!
 God would not allow that to happen.
 It's not God we are dealing with, it is the Northmen, the Danes!
 Non-believers, over whom we will triumph.
 Should a great battle come of this, we shall have men enough to face them.
 I expect the fyrd of Mercia to be at our side.
 It shall be there, Lord.
 The metal will be paid, in full.
 My daughter will be spared and Wessex shall avoid indignity.
 But not the slaughter.
 0dda, I hear your doubts and I ask you to renew your faith.
 Yes, Lord.
 Aethelred, you will join Father Beocca and I before returning to Mercia.
 We must decide how best to gather the ransom.
 Yes, Lord.
 This cannot be how it ends.
 Lord, you have said all you can say.
 And bravely.
 There's nothing more for you to do, so I beg you, do nothing.
 Lord?
 Lord?
 Dagfinn, you can go.
 All of you.
 Yes, Lord.
 Do you have it?
 Is that enough?
 Yes.
 Uhtred can read?
 All of my father's ealdormen can read and write.
 Although the letters Uhtred has written, you could count with one finger.
 I will teach you.
 What is to prevent him from doing nothing?
 We are asking him to risk everything for no reward.
 Why should he come?
 It is Uhtred, he will come.
 I swear.
 He's with her, again?
 He is.
 He cannot keep away from her.
 Let us hope he does not take her for his wife 
 or else our fortune is lost.
 Is this true, huh?
 Sigefrid!
 Which woman is mine?
 The ugly one.
 We walked them for miles, see they are fed and watered.
 Horses and slaves.
 
 You are called Sihtric?
 Yes, Lord.
 Good evening to you, Lord.
 Uhtred says you can be trusted.
 So you will take him this letter.
 This is a great responsibility.
 They will have no peace.
 None.
 I have told them the same.
 But you will still help them?
 I must, I have no choice.
 If they escape then there will be no ransom paid.
 No great army.
 The men of Wessex are saved, yes, but what becomes of you?
 Of us?
 Alfred will see it as a betrayal.
 You will have broken your oath.
 We leave.
 Tomorrow I will make a sacrifice to keep you safe.
 All of us?
 Give your name to the scribe.
 The sum of your contribution will be written beside your name.
 We're helping to free the Lady Aethelflaed.
 I've got nothing to give, I've got a family.
 Any man or woman found to be hiding the value of their wealth shall be punished.
 All must pay their share.
 You have the gratitude of the King, and of God.
 Name?
 Dorridge.
 Lord?
 News, Lord.
 Speak.
 Say to the King exactly what you said to me.
 Exactly.
 Lord, this man is from Canterbury.
 The Northmen at Beamfleot are now crossing the river and raiding directly into Wessex.
 They have taken my wife and daughters, Lord.
 The youngest is just eight years.
 While we do nothing, Lord, but gather half-pennies from the poor.
 Father, you will take this man away, feed him and give him rest at an inn.
 Lord.
 0dda, what is it you want?
 Lord, he is just one man, but he has lost two brothers at Ethandun, two daughters and a wife to the Northmen, and yet guards will knock at his door and demand one third of the little he has, all to help preserve the dignity of Wessex.
 This insolence is too much.
 Then in six months' time we shall ask for his life!
 What I want, Lord, is for good sense to prevail.
 By good sense, I presume you mean the death or humiliation of my daughter and of the reputation of Wessex?
 Or we march, Lord, and we fight.
 If we march they will kill her.
 And she will be considered a martyr, for Wessex, Lord, her dignity preserved!
 And you would still have the Prince, Edward, your line is intact!
 0dda, what has saved you from outright banishment is that you chose your King over your own son.
 Lord, I chose Wessex over my son.
 A traitor!
 You should at least consider doing the same!
 What am I to do with you?
 Your injury and your appetite for wine have robbed us both of your worth.
 You no longer serve a purpose.
 Then, with your permission, Lord, I shall return to my estate and my wife at Devonshire.
 Whilst it is still a Saxon estate.
 That would be for the best.
 Should you be needed you will be sent for.
 They buy the very swords that will slay them.
 Lord, good evening.
 I am a moth to the flame.
 Yes, it is becoming a significant amount.
 Significant is the word, Lord, in its size and its effect.
 Your father The King?
 He would have done the same.
 Pay such a ransom for his offspring, Lord?
 I doubt it.
 I was a great disappointment to him which I regret.
 But if you were not such a disappointment, Aethelwold, I may have had you killed.
 For the good of Wessex.
 Never doubt it, every decision I make is for my country.
 Yes, Lord.
 I understand completely.
 Lord 0dda.
 You will set tongues wagging, drinking with the peasants.
 Let them wag if it please them.
 You asked me some days ago if I agree with the payment of a ransom.
 I do not.
 If I had an army to call upon, a fyrd to raise, I would prove it.
 But I have not.
 I appear to have joined you, Lord.
 He's been there for part of the day and all of the night.
 He's a good man and I worry that it will damage his reputation, Lord.
 If he can stand, it can only enhance his reputation.
 Lord.
 May we join you?
 Is he here still or has he already left?
 Aethelwold?
 Erm, no, he's long gone, Lord.
 Perhaps you've drank enough, Lord?
 It is entirely possible.
 Though the ale they brew here is weak upon the orders of Alfred.
 You'rejoking, Lord.
 What, that's true?
 It is, yes.
 It is so a man can work the next day, and swords remain in scabbards.
 But they must not.
 Somebody needs a bed.
 And you will stay with him?
 And do what?
 If he needs to piss or spew up, you'll fetch him a bucket.
 I have a plan, though it is likely I will die.
 What is this plan, Lord, tell me?
 I will raise the Devonshire fyrd.
 Against the King's wishes, Lord?
 That is not something he would forgive.
 Lord?!
 He will go nowhere.
 And you will go nowhere and you will say nothing about what you have just heard.
 Yes, Lord.
 You mean, "No, Lord".
 I Do aslsay.
 
 So, what does it say?
 Erik has enough oathmen to crew a ship.
 Three nights before the first of the metal is to be delivered, we make our way down river to Beamfleot.
 We kill the men that stand guard over the ships.
 Erik and Aethelflaed sail away.
 And Wessex is saved.
 How many guards?
 Eight or ten, on the shore.
 That is all?
 Yes.
 It's as simple as that?
 Erik is in command, his men guard Aethelflaed, his ship is ready and waiting.
 It begins, it's simple.
 What happens is fate.
 Well, why go by river and not horseback?
 If we go with the tide it'll be faster, and to escape we tow across river.
 They will follow you.
 They will follow Aethelflaed.
 She's the silver.
 Father Pyrlig?
 Lord.
 You came from nowhere, like the devil himself.
 You're leaving us?
 I am.
 I've invited myself to Devonshire with the Lord 0dda.
 Looking forward to cooling my feet in the blue waters of the sea.
 You're spying for Alfred.
 Of course I'm spying for Alfred, I despise the sea.
 Should 0dda decide to do anything rash, you will tell him to hold fast?
 And why should he listen to me?
 Do you have a reason you would like to share?
 He is behind you.
 Lord?
 Did you sleep well?
 Uhtred, I did, soundly.
 Though I'm not sure how I found my bed.
 You were a little worse for ale, Lord, but no bother.
 I'm glad to hear it.
 You spoke of a plan.
 I did?
 Mm-hm.
 Am I to be reminded?
 The men of Devonshire.
 They should remain in the fields.
 I must have been very drunk.
 It can be the only explanation, Lord.
 Yes.
 You swear?
 On my life.
 I have no memory of it whatsoever.
 Lord, I dare say this to you as your friend, do nothing.
 If I do not see you again, Uhtred of Bebbanburg, I wish you good luck, wherever fate may take you.
 Thank you, Lord.
 Should we pray, Lord?
 Together?
 Am I being selfish, in wanting to spare Aethelflaed?
 Lord, you were her father before you were a king.
 But your reasons stand she is Wessex.
 She's the blood, the heart and the spirit of Wessex.
 She cannot be humiliated.
 Dagfinn!
 Dagfinn!
 Where is she?
 Lord?
 I Where is she?
 Now it is clear.
 Each man has a right to see her.
 And every man will guard her with his life!
 She is our wealth.
 She belongs to us all!
 
 Dear God!
 Who might they be?
 They are the Devonshire fyrd, Father Pyrlig.
 You are here as Alfred's spy.
 You will go no further.
 You will get down from your horse and you will walk back to Winchester with your news.
 And what news is that, Lord?
 What do you mean?
 You will tell the King that 0dda is marching against the enemies of Wessex.
 He can either march to halt me or march to join me, it does not matter which.
 Once the Northmen at Beamfleot see an army, battle will follow.
 Please, Lord.
 Think about what you are doing, you are making traitors of your men!
 The men you see are here to die for their King, not betray him.
 They know nothing of Alfred's weakness.
 But Uhtred, Lord!
 Did he not ask you to do nothing?
 You will get down from your horse and you will return to Winchester.
 And if I refuse?
 Now, Father Pyrlig.
 Lord, I beg you, think again.
 Thank you.
 What's your name?
 I asked for ten, Dagfinn!
 How are we supposed to scrub down a ship with three men?
 The men refuse to leave the hall, Lord.
 Refuse?
 They say they are protecting their wealth, under the orders of Sigefrid.
 Who said this?
 Name them.
 Your brother has called for more guards, Lord, until the metal comes.
 Erik!
 You have been sleeping at the river.
 Why?
 You have made a fool of me.
 You have humped her enough.
 You have fed and washed her enough.
 Do not allow the men to see what I know for certain you have grown too fond of her.
 It is not her arse you want, it is herself.
 It will pass.
 You have shamed me.
 What I have done is protect you.
 Erik, my brother, what is happening around us is your plan.
 And it is a fine plan to give up Lunden and take the Princess to ransom her for ships full of gold and silver, on which we will build an army that no man will want to face and every man will want to join.
 This will be our land.
 All of it.
 I will not allow us to fail.
 Haesten!
 A guard every ten paces.
 Yes, Lord.
 Forgive me, Lord, it's not that the men do not want to serve you.
 It is that they do not know where your loyalties lie.
 
 Oh, SweetJesus, I cannot run.
 Please let them be Saxon.
 Father Pyrlig.
 Lord!
 Thank the Heavens, a friendly face.
 Are you lost, Father?
 Not lost but abandoned, Lord.
 I'm returning to Winchester with an important message for Alfred.
 We're going to see Alfred.
 Climb onto the cart.
 You can help guard Mercia's ransom.
 God bless you, Lord, saviour of my blistered feet.
 Lord?
 Osferth?
 Can I say to you that I'm afraid?
 I wear a sword but barely know how to use it.
 I pray that when battle comes, I will not fail you.
 Osferth, at times we're all afraid.
 Courage is finding the will to overcome yourfear, nothing more.
 Perhaps we'll find you an axe.
 It requires less skill than a sword.
 But you must find the courage.
 Yes, Lord.
 Thank you, Lord.
 Father Pyrlig?
 Aethelred and Aldhelm I was expecting.
 It is 0dda, Lord.
 Prior to leaving Winchester, he senta man, some man, with word to raise the fighting men of Devonshire.
 He has now met them on the road, Lord.
 With the intention of doing what?
 He is marching against Beamfleot.
 Yes, Lord, he is.
 Damn him.
 I say damn him.
 Lord, are we to stop him?
 We have no other choice but to stop him!
 We must stop him.
 Lord, may I ask, where is Uhtred?
 He was not beside 0dda, if that is your meaning.
 And it cannot have been Uhtred who carried the message to Devonshire.
 Aethelred, you have how many men with you?
 0ver 50, Lord.
 Household guard.
 I can send for many more.
 You will do that.
 Rest your men and horses, but you will join me and my own guard before first light.
 If we are to halt 0dda, we must march day and night and we must pray.
 [AETHELFLAED] Dear Lord God in Heaven grant me the strength to survive this ordeal.
 Give me the courage to overcome these hardships and instil within me faith.
 Faith in those I love.
 For they will not abandon me.
 Lord, I beg of you.
 Amen.
 Amen.
 You!
 With me!
 Now!
 20 guards!
 Sihtric, you said it would be no more than eight or ten.
 He cannot count.
 No, Lord, it has never been more than ten men.
 Rypere's group will strike first from the water.
 They look to the river, and then we kill them.
 But, Lord, we are just 11.
 Rypere!
 Two each.
 We attack as soon as it's dark.
 Brother.
 May I speak?
 I've something to say!
 I have something to say to each of you.
 You will be disappointed to know that this woman here is now mine.
 No man is to touch her.
 Not with his hands, and most certainly not with his cock!
 She belongs to me!
 You weakened me, brother.
 It should have been me who took the Princess and put her in a cage.
 Yes, you're right.
 I did not think.
 You never think.
 No!
 Because I have you to think for me.
 It is three nights before the first of the silver will arrive.
 We must be ready.
 Tomorrow there will be no more ale, no more games, no more fighting over women!
 But that is tomorrow.
 Tonight we drink as if there were no tomorrow!
 
 Lady!
 Have faith.
 It is tonight.
 Men, calm yourselves!
 Get the shields!
 Rypere!
 
 You!
 That's enough!
 He's not your kill.
 That is not how you wet your sword.
 Find your courage!
 Or find your cross and go back to the monastery as Alfred would wish.
 We shall rest for a short time only.
 Take rest.
 Stay alert.
 I want watchmen front and rear.
 Feed the horses and yourselves.
 0dda is out there.
 He is near.
 As is Aethelflaed, Lord.
 We are here for 0dda.
 Erik should have been here by now.
 Something's wrong.
 Why increase the number of guards?
 For what reason?
 Do we care?
 They are dead.
 We go to the fortress.
 We do?
 We came to free Aethelflaed.
 We came to kill the guards.
 Bastard, you will say nothing!
 The guards will soon be discovered missing, and when they are, it's over.
 We cannot wait.
 But, Lord, we've lost half our men.
 And there are hundreds of them, both inside and outside the fortress.
 Then a few more men will not be noticed.
 We go to the fortress.
 Uhtred.
 She said that you would come.
 I dared not believe her, but you are here.
 Tell me what has changed.
 In truth?
 It is hopeless.
 I have no crew for my ship, but the first task is not how we escape Beamfleot, it is how we free Aethelflaed.
 She hangs where every man can see her.
 Lord, I enjoy a fight as much as the next idiot, but this is beyond us.
 She's inside the hall?
 Inside the hall, inside a cage.
 Surrounded by men.
 Warriors.
 Then we must first get rid of the men.
 We do it now.
 fire!
 fire!
 fire!
 Outside now!
 Quickly!
 Put the fire out before it spreads!
 
 Find something to carry water!
 Six men, stay with the Princess!
 Lock the doors!
 Uhtred!
 Clapa, Sihtric, the cage!
 Come on!
 This is one bastard lock to break!
 Get it done before we burn!
 It's all cleared, the hall of men, Lord.
 Now, how do we clear the yard?
 They will follow the silver.
 Up to the ramparts!
 Go!
 Go!
 Where did this begin?
 Lady, quickly, run for the rear gate.
 Do not stop!
 The Princess!
 Stop her!
 After her!
 Get to your horses!
 Go!
 Where is he?
 Erik!
 Where is he?
 Lord, I do not know.
 I have not seen him outside of the hall!
 No!
 Erik!
 Erik!
 Do not do this.
 Do not dare to do this!
 Brother, please let me have this one chance.
 I cannot let her go.
 She's our fortune!
 She's our reputation!
 If it's reputation you want, you can begin with killing me.
 Uhtred, no!
 If you want your fortune, you must kill me!
 No!
 Argh!
 Clapa, the cage!
 Uhtred, get her out of here!
 Erik, no!
 No We need to go.
 Aethelflaed!
 No!
 You You did this.
 You've killed us both.
 Quickly!
 Cla pa, with us!
 Cla pa!
 Cla pa!
 We go!
 She's escaping with Uhtred!
 I want them dead!
 Everyone after them!
 Go!
 Lord, I'm grateful to see you, as are my men.
 I've told each one of them we are here on the orders of Alfred.
 Lord, as you appear to have marched an army to their door, I doubt the Northmen will believe you are not here to fight.
 Why, 0dda?
 Why?
 For Wessex, Lord.
 Only for Wessex.
 Lord, the sky!
 It must be Beamfleot.
 It is an army, Lord!
 It's 0dda.
 It's 0dda's army!
 Stand ready!
 Stand ready!
 Good God, I think it is Uhtred.
 It is her, it is Aethelflaed.
 They have her.
 Lord, we are being pursued by Sigefrid.
 The Danes are low in number and disorganised.
 My advice is that we kill them all.
 Steapa, put a guard around my daughter.
 Keep her safe.
 Father, I want to fight them!
 You will do as I say!
 Erik is dead, Lord.
 Sigefrid will have no mind to negotiate nor wait.
 He wants Saxon blood.
 We have to fight!
 Shield wall, Lord.
 Only you can give the order.
 Lord, we only have a fraction of their number.
 We cannot win.
 I am ready.
 Lord?
 To die.
 It will be today.
 Who is with me?
 
 Who is ready for glory or Valhalla?
 
 Shield wall!
 Shield wall!
 Shield wall!
 Faster!
 Move!
 Move!
 Forwards!
 Faster!
 Shield!
 Shield!
 
 Fill the breach!
 Build the wall!
 
 Princess!
 I see you, Princess, and I will kill you!
 I will have your head and your tits!
 Sigefrid!
 Sigefrid!
 Princess!
 Princess!
 Sigefrid!
 I'm here!
 Face me!
 Leave us.
 Uhtred, there are no words.
 Say nothing.
 You answered my call at the risk of everything.
 I only wish he did survive, Lady.
 Erik is still with me.
 And perhaps within me.
 And if over the coming months, my husband should think what you are thinking, it would be a great comfort, Uhtred, to know that I could call upon you again, should I ever need to.
 Of course.
 Do you swear?
 You are the man I trust most, Uhtred of Bebbanburg.
 I swear.
 I swear, Lady.
 Then I shall dare to kiss you.
 It seems you have made a habit of rescuing Wessex.
 0dda claims that you believed you were acting upon my orders, Uhtred.
 What will happen to him?
 There will be a trial.
 And then you will kill him.
 Treachery could not be ignored.
 He's a good man.
 He is my friend and a traitor.
 May I go, Lord?
 You are free to go.
 As my oathman.
 I would have liked to have seen my land of Devonshire once more.
 How did it look?
 Devonshire was beautiful, Lord.
 God be with you.
 
 
 [Uhtred] What binds a man to his land?
 What power within allows him to give his life to preserve his land and the lives of the families who work it?
 It can only be love.
 It will not be written that the Lord 0dda saved Wessex but that is the story I will tell that he gave his life to save the lives of many and ensured King Alfred of Wessex became more powerful than ever.
 Sigefrid had been defeated but Alfred knew as well as I that the Danes were sure to return.
 Shackled by oaths to both Wessex and Mercia, it seems fate has made my sword Saxon, even though in my heart I remain a Dane.
 I, Uhtred, son of Uhtred, shall be the warrior to bind kingdom to kingdom, honour-bound to forge Alfred's dream of an England.
 But one day, my sword will belong to Bebbanburg.
 Destiny is all.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SEASON: 02
EPISODE: 07
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred.
 Lady Aethelflaed has followed her father's wishes and married Aethelred, the Lord of Mercia.
 Bringing King Alfred's dream of an England ever closer.
 Lord, love should be gentle and kind.
 In a happier union, Father Beocca has married my sister, Thyra.
 Excuse me, Lord Uhtred.
 I am Osferth.
 You are Alfred's bastard son.
 After failing to convince me to join them, the Northmen brothers, Erik and Sigefrid, have taken the city of Lunden.
 You say you are sworn, yet you float into Daneland and back again.
 How am I to trust you?
 Alfred put Aethelred in command of his armies Tomorrow we ride.
 I would like you to travel with me.
 To battle? . . and we were sent to take back the city but found not a soul.
 If we wish, there is a way to raise the greatest army these shores have ever seen.
 Lord!
 It's a signal that can be seen from a mile or more.
 Thyra!
 Death is coming.
 The forest!
 The forest!
 It's a trick, I know it.
 And I fear terrible consequences.
 Destiny is all.
 THEME MUSIC No, no.
 Please, God, let this not be true.
 Thyra!
 Lady Aethelflaed!
 Thyra!
 Thyra!
 Please be alive, please be alive, please be alive.
 Lady Aethelflaed!
 Thyra!
 Thyra, please!
 Thyra!
 Lady Aethelflaed!
 Not a single man left living.
 Nor woman.
 She is the daughter of King Alfred, they would not kill her.
 They They would not.
 Thyra!
 Please.
 Beocca!
 Beocca!
 Thyra!
 Beocca!
 Thyra!
 Beocca!
 Thyra!
 Beocca!
 I thought you were dead and I wanted to die!
 I thought you were dead.
 I thought you were dead!
 Thyra?
 Thyra?
 Thyra, where is Aethelflaed?
 You will answer!
 Of course she will answer!
 I do not know.
 Did they take her?!
 We ran and then she was gone.
 We will continue the search, Lord.
 They've taken her, they must have.
 Why else abandon the city, why raid the camp?
 She is the daughter of the King.
 They wouldn't dare.
 We will scour the camp and beyond!
 We are looking for the Lady Aethelflaed!
 Where are you taking me?
 You have found your voice.
 We're headed to Beamfleot.
 And then?
 A ship?
 A cage?
 I'm still to decide.
 I have given up Lunden for you.
 Erik!
 How does she feel?
 Warm?
 Rich.
 As she should.
 She is our pathway to glory.
 THEY LAUGH What will you say to Alfred?
 What can I tell him but the truth?
 He will ask why she was with you.
 She should never have been there.
 I am aware of that.
 You say she insisted, begged.
 You're so enthralled by your bride that you could not deny her.
 And make myself appear weak?
 It is a choice, Lord, between appearing love-sick, or foolish.
 Uhtred?
 Uhtred, where are you going?
 I'm going home to Coccham, where Alfred has asked me to remain!
 And where I left my wife.
 But the King, he may need you.
 The King, in his wisdom, has all but banished him, Father Beocca.
 You should also raise the question of how the Northmen came to know of Aethelflaed's situation, of where she would be.
 If you believe her to be alive, you will not abandon her.
 You will not.
 That is a fact.
 So, what is the real reason we're travelling home to Coccham and not to Winchester?
 There's nothing to be said in Winchester.
 I won't be part of a whispering court.
 We will go when I have something to say, not before.
 Sihtric.
 Lord?
 Take Rypere there and go to Beamfleot.
 That is where Erik and Sigefrid's fleet lie, that is where they'll be.
 We are to spy?
 You're to confirm that Lady Aethelflaed is alive and how they're treating her.
 Send Rypere back to me at Coccham.
 You will remain there and, yes, you are to spy.
 Sihtric, I will need to know every part of Beamfleot.
 Every blade of grass that surrounds their fortress.
 Yes, Lord.
 See this?
 Warriors join us by the day.
 With word of your capture, there will be more.
 All waiting for war.
 You have my thanks, Lady.
 There will be many men inside.
 They will want to get close to you, look you in the eye.
 They'll want to frighten me.
 They will.
 CHEERING SHE GASPS AND GRUNTS What did I say?!
 I told you I would invite King Alfred's daughter, and she is here!
 THEY CHEER I swear to the gods . .
 that this prize will not be sold cheaply.
 There will be wealth and glory for every man here.
 THEY CHEER It is the best we have.
 These are my own men, they will watch you.
 You will have a guard at all times.
 You will be safe here.
 And my companions, my servants, from the camp?
 Any woman who is not Aethelflaed will have been killed or claimed.
 Claimed is most likely.
 There's a bucket in the corner.
 A royal bucket, no splinters.
 CHUCKLING DOOR LOCKS Aethelred.
 I was expecting a messenger, and not for days.
 My news is too important to trust to a messenger.
 Lunden has been reclaimed.
 Praise God.
 Not a single Northman has been left alive in the city but this great victory has come at a significant cost.
 It is the way of battle.
 It concerns Aethelflaed, Lord.
 What of her?
 We fear that she has been taken.
 We pray that is the outcome, Lord.
 By the Northmen?
 Aethelflaed was with you?
 All the things they will do to her She was there?
 You took my daughter into battle?
 There was no battle, Lord.
 She was not part of the attacking army, Lord, of course not.
 She was a good distance away.
 But clearly not a safe distance.
 Admittedly, I was weak, but she is headstrong and eager.
 She asked to travel a part of the way You are her husband.
 She makes it difficult for me to refuse her.
 Is she alive?
 Have you seen her alive?
 Answer me that.
 She must be alive, Lord.
 What reason would they have to kill her?
 But you do not know for certain?
 No.
 How they knew she was with us, we do not know.
 Uhtred believes they may have returned to Beamfleot.
 He knows them well.
 Uhtred has returned to Coccham, Lord.
 He was following your earlier instructions, Lord.
 After hearing of events and excuses . .
 what I now require are facts.
 I have men across the land.
 I will send word and ask for word.
 That is all I can do.
 That is all we can do.
 My dear.
 Lord, you have my word!
 I shall recover her!
 Do you know what you've done?
 Possibly not, as you are as useless as you are arrogant.
 I have done nothing but carry out the King's orders.
 You have put at risk the entire kingdom!
 All kingdoms!
 You're a toad, a fool, an idiot with ambition far above your capability.
 And if I can see this, be sure Alfred can see it.
 You have made your position clear, Lord Odda.
 We will forgive your insolence just this one You will forgive me?!
 You will not address my lord in that manner!
 May I suggest that you take a wander for yet another cup of wine?
 Father Beocca, Steapa, come with me.
 You will tell me every detail from the moment you left Winchester.
 With me!
 Yes, Lord.
 "Lunden has been reclaimed and not a single Northman "has been left alive in the city." You began so well.
 I will be reminding the King who it was who travelled into Daneland.
 I will be reminding the King that your friend Uhtred has been called King of Mercia, and I shall remind him how fond you are of his seat.
 Do that.
 But allow me to remind you of this-the only man capable of cleaning up this puddle of shit is the man you are desperate to blame.
 Uhtred King of Mercia.
 WATER LAPS What is on your mind?
 I am thinking of Aethelflaed.
 If she lives, you will be her hope.
 Alfred is her father.
 YOU will be her hope, Uhtred of Bebbenberg.
 It should not be for you to resolve, but you will do it.
 By sending Sihtric, you have already begun.
 Stay with me.
 No, I am hungry!
 I will help you.
 No, I'm doing it!
 I think I have something!
 Supper at last!
 Oh!
 He's a sea monster!
 Lord.
 You said I should find you.
 Who are you?
 He's Alfred's bastard.
 I am called Osferth, Lady.
 I am simply called Osferth.
 Every person in every town has been instructed to pray, that she is alive and kept well.
 Then, she will surely be alive, kept well, and will be free in no time.
 All right, say goodnight.
 You do not believe, Lord?
 Oh, I believe but in the true gods.
 And in fate.
 You wish to serve a heathen, Osferth?
 God is in all good men, Lady.
 And my Uncle Leofric told me often that your husband is a good man.
 A great man.
 He said that?
 Yes, he did, Lord.
 And yet this good man here will let you join him for one reason only.
 To embarrass Alfred.
 It's true.
 That may be the reason you allow me to join you, Lord, but I will give you reason to let me stay.
 You have been brought here by fate, Osferth.
 If all they have in Winchester is prayer, then they will need something more.
 We will go to Winchester.
 We will not.
 This is what you want to do, so why be childish about it?
 We will go when I have news .  from Beamfleot.
 YELLING THEY LAUGH DOOR OPENS My men tell me you are refusing to eat.
 I am.
 I would like to wash.
 You have a bowl, you have water.
 I would like to bathe!
 I would like to breathe cool air.
 I am beginning to feel sickly.
 My brother suggested you bathe inside a barrel in full view of all men.
 DOOR SHUTS Lady I will arrange for you to bathe with privacy, but in return you must eat the food we provide.
 Very well.
 Agreed.
 Thank you.
 I feel she is alive, in my heart, but what might they do to her?
 She has her mother's courage, and that is the very reason that she will survive this ordeal.
 Lord King, although I would usually prefer him miles away at Coccham .. would it now be appropriate to recall Uhtred to Winchester?
 I accept that he will never know God I cannot.
 But if you would send him to Beamfleot, if she saw him You know that I cannot. . . perhaps her spirit would rise.
 She believes in him.
 Our belief is in God, in prayer.
 It is.
 I will leave you to your letters.
 We have our proof, Rypere, you will go to Uhtred.
 Now!
 Why so many guards?
 Are you afraid of me?
 You're a prize, Lady.
 Even when unwashed.
 She's the daughter of a King, you will all turn away!
 Show her the backs of your heads!
 Lord, where is the harm in looking?
 The back of your heads!
 You were right, Lord she has beauty.
 She does.
 More than that, she's worth ten times her weight in gold and silver.
 I'm thinking we should fatten her.
 Does this game have a name?
 Stones.
 And why's it called that?
 It's Rypere.
 He must have news from Beamfleot.
 I'll go and tell Uhtred.
 Uhtred!
 Uhtred!
 Uhtred!
 Lord, if the Northmen from Beamfleot are now raiding into Mercia to feed their army, how long before they come to Wessex?
 Is it not time to consider raising the fyrds?
 Aethelwold, as you have no estate, it is not your place to talk of raising fyrds.
 As for the ealdormen with estate for each of you there is a harvest to be gathered.
 This must be done quickly and stored within the nearest burh, it must be protected.
 Should they raid, we shall not be overrun and importantly we shall not feed them so much as a single grain.
 Wessex is fortified.
 Once the harvest is gathered, the fighting men of the fyrds shall be free of labour, should they be required.
 Should they be required, Lord?!
 Mercia requires them now.
 The heathen must be dealt with!
 The heathen hold a hostage, Lord Selwine.
 Would you have the Lady Aethelflaed killed?
 Lord King, I do not wish to cause distress, but if the lady was in fact alive, surely they would have made clear their demands?
 They want us supplicant, Selwine, they want us afraid.
 They do not know of our faith, Lord.
 DOOR OPENS Father Pyrlig?
 Excuse me, Lord, but Uhtred of this parish is here.
 He is asking to attend.
 Can he be trusted?
 Lord?
 Are we sure of Uhtred's position?
 Lord Uhtred's position is that of an ealdorman of Wessex.
 Lord, it is my own view that he should be admitted.
 And mine.
 Allow him in.
 Lord King?
 The Ealdorman Uhtred may join the Witan.
 Yes, Lord.
 Lord.
 Lady Aelswith.
 I am here with news of Aethelflaed.
 From the Northmen?
 From my own spies, who sleep within the walls of Beamfleot.
 Lord, Aethelflaed is alive.
 My men have seen her with their own eyes.
 Praise Him.
 Praise Him to the heavens.
 Then, why have they not made clear their demands?
 They've been spreading news of their hostage, Lord.
 Boasting?
 About seizing a woman?
 Boasting of the great army they will raise with the ransom.
 This is what I fear, Lord.
 No man in this hall should be in any doubt, when their demands arrive, they will be considerable.
 As will be the consequences.
 Of course, they will make outrageous demands.
 That is the purpose of strong negotiation to ensure there is agreement.
 You intend to negotiate, Lord?
 I intend to recover my daughter.
 Regardless of the price, Lord?
 Mercia is not a land of plenty-far from it.
 Wessex shall pay its share of silver and, if necessary, its share of blood!
 I will do what needs to be done.
 If that means negotiation, then I will negotiate.
 Lord, I would advise that you don't attend the negotiations.
 The presence of the King and father would only serve to increase their price.
 But if not the King, then who?
 LOUD MURMURINGS There will be silence!
 Aethelred?
 Yes, Lord?
 It must be you.
 This is for Mercia to resolve.
 You must go to Beamfleot.
 Of course, Lord.
 And a representative of Wessex, Lord, as the burden of your daughter is to be shared between the two kingdoms.
 I will suggest that the Lord Uhtred represents Wessex.
 Agreed.
 Forgive me, Lord, but I do believe he is your only choice.
 Lord?
 Uhtred, you will accompany Aethelred.
 I will do all I can, Lord.
 Lady.
 Uhtred.
 Uhtred, forgive me, but I have asked the King to excuse me from this journey to Beamfleot.
 For my sins, God has always placed me at your side.
 And I feel shame for abandoning you.
 No, Beocca, your place is in Winchester with Thyra.
 Bless you.
 Uhtred, you have given me so much, but giving me the courage to approach Thyra-that was your greatest gift.
 I will be in your prayers, no doubt.
 Perhaps.
 Always.
 Say it's mine!
 My men are restless.
 Hunting is not enough.
 I may go across the river, spill a little blood.
 Across the river is Wessex.
 Then, if I see Alfred, I will tell him that my brother is humping his daughter.
 I can see that you like her.
 I would like to ride her, yes.
 Then, ride her.
 One tiny cock isn't going to hurt her.
 Haesten, what are you doing?
 Shut your mouth, Dagfinn.
 You saw nothing.
 What do you want?
 What do I want?
 I'm here to remind you that you're a woman and a hostage.
 I like the paleness of your skin.
 Show me.
 Take off your clothes.
 Does the Lord Erik know that you're here?
 It was the Lord Erik that sent me.
 Now, remove your clothes or I will rip them from you!
 SHE YELLS OU Dagfinn, hold her!
 Get up!
 GET UP!
 Lord, she's a hostage!
 Get up onto your feet.
 She is a hostage.
 She is precious.
 She's of value!
 Release her.
 Leave us!
 All of you!
 This should not have happened, and it will not happen again.
 My apologies.
 My apologies.
 It is not the first time a man has mistreated me.
 Who else?
 Not here.
 Before here.
 Now I know what to do should it happen again.
 I will use my night bucket and a knife.
 You should.
 You are precious, Lady.
 Sleep well.
 Safely.
 DISTANT YELLING AND SWORDS ECHO Odda.
 It is late.
 I was about to sit, contemplate.
 As is your habit, Lord.
 I have been waiting for you.
 Lord, I hope you will forgive me for what I'm about to say.
 My intentions are for Wessex, for the hope of an England.
 You spoke of paying for Aethelflaed's release in one of two ways-with silver, or with blood.
 I did.
 There is a third way.
 Should the ransom be too great, should the likely loss of men be too great, should Wessex wish to emerge with honour, Lord, and greater strength then should she not be encouraged to take her own life?
 For the good of the kingdom.
 Some might say it would mean martyrdom.
 I hear you, Odda.
 I'm glad you feel able to proffer this advice.
 Now, I wish to sit.
 You will leave me.
 Lord Look around you, see the sacrifice that has been made.
 Hundreds upon hundreds of men, women and children have given their lives for what we now have They have GIVEN their lives, Odda, they did not TAKE their lives.
 And there will be reward in heaven for each and every soul, that is what we believe, is it not?
 That is what I say, Lord, there will be reward enough, in heaven.
 You are a king before you are a father.
 I know my place!
 Now you will leave me.
 Lord.
 I thought you'd like to breathe the night's air.
 Thank you.
 I was born on a night of a whole moon.
 My father wanted to call me Mani, after the moon god.
 But Mani is chased each night across the sky by Hati the wolf.
 My mother did not want me to be chased by wolves.
 I saw the moon, the clear sky and I wanted to share it.
 I'm glad you thought of me.
 It was either share it with you or with my brother.
 THEY LAUGH The choice was difficult, I admit!
 I have never seen a face like this before.
 Now I see it, even when I close my eyes.
 Your husband is a fortunate man.
 My husband does not see me.
 Then, he's blind or stupid.
 He is not blind.
 And he is not gentle, I would guess.
 He is the one who mistreats you?
 He is not the man I would choose to be with.
 You.
 You!
 Aethelwold.
 Odda, you are drunk.
 I sincerely hope so, I can barely see.
 At your age, it is not good for you.
 What is your opinion on paying a ransom for Aethelflaed?
 Do you have an opinion?
 Not one I am prepared to say aloud.
 Is there much, or any, of your father in you?
 The king past?
 I'm disappointed you need to ask.
 I have both my father's blood and spirit, the Danes know it.
 Even the dead know it.
 THUNDER RUMBLES I am becoming more like him by the day-observe the clean tunic.
 He was a great man.
 He was my great friend.
 If you are indeed his son, I may need you.
 You may need me for what?
 I believe you need your bed, Lord.
 And a pillow.
 You should employ a craftsman to fit a spoon in place of the blade.
 The leaves are falling.
 I want the ransom paid in full by winter, an army by spring.
 A king's crown by summer.
 They will want the same, answers by winter.
 How does she ride?
 Oh, you wouldn't like her-she's bony and she squeals.
 She passes the time.
 And if you put a pup in her belly?
 Then, Alfred will get two for the price of one.
 THEY LAUGH And Viking blood to strengthen his line, eh?
 What will happen when we reach Beamfleot?
 Will there be a ritual, a toast, a meal?
 There will be a heathen sacrifice the youngest member of the visiting party will be split with an axe.
 They will want to humiliate us.
 In what way?
 An insult, a challenge.
 Why
 Because they can.
 Haesten.
 We're travelling to Beamfleot.
 For Alfred?
 For Alfred, yes.
 I am here to take you on to the fortress, Lord.
 You and two others.
 I will travel with half my number, no less.
 Agreed.
 The Lady Aethelflaed?
 She is well?
 There'll be no negotiation until I have seen her!
 She is well.
 My Lord Erik sees that she is most content, Lord.
 Ride on and we'll follow.
 Oh, you will not be needing horses.
 Lord, I have a question.
 What is it we want from this meeting?
 You have to ask?
 What we want is to free Aethelflaed.
 And if instead, what transpired was war-what then?
 It is a question, Lord, that is all.
 I would be without a wife, no doubt, as that would be the cause of war.
 war will occur regardless, that is certain.
 The only change that there can be is the size of the army that we will face across the field.
 We will be ready.
 But what is it we want?
 Alfred wants his daughter, that is plain, but is that best for Mercia?
 Is that best for Aethelred, Lord of Mercia, and Lunden, and more, perhaps?
 My advice to you, Lord, is rescue her by all means, but not at a price that will cut our throats.
 You will all kneel.
 We will not.
 We have come here in peace and as equals.
 You've made us walk a good distance to meet you.
 That is respect enough.
 You should have joined me, Uhtred.
 If you wished me to join you, why have a dead man tell a prophecy?
 Why didn't you simply ask?
 Me, you would refuse, but the gods?
 The King of Wessex sends his greetings.
 He hopes you have enjoyed the company of his daughter.
 HE LAUGHS Enjoyed her?
 Oh, she's not his favourite.
 Why else would he have allowed her to marry the pig's arse standing behind me?
 Before any negotiations take place, the pig's arse wishes to be certain that his wife is well.
 And if she's not well?
 What then?
 What will the pig's arse do?
 Fart?
 Will you fight me?
 Will you fight my brother?
 I would like that.
 You alone will kneel.
 I will not.
 Kneel!
 JEERING I have come to negotiate.
 I demand respect.
 If you do not wish to hear my price, then I will leave!
 Happily!
 Aethelflaed.
 As you can see, she is well.
 I would like to speak with her.
 Then, do it.
 They are treating you well?
 They are.
 You have not been touched?
 I have not.
 What I must now do is secure an acceptable price for your release.
 There will be word games played, do not be alarmed by what I may say.
 I assure you, once this is over, they shall pay for what they have done to us all.
 Thank you, Lord.
 What is your price?
 It must be fair, or you can keep her.
 You talk of your woman like you do not care.
 She is important to me, of course, but she has a price, beyond which I cannot go.
 I will not go.
 Then name it.
 Name this price.
 100lb weight of silver.
 My lands can afford no more.
 Does this man speak for Alfred?
 He does not.
 Hmm.
 Weland!
 Where is Weland?!
 I do not see him.
 Weland!
 Weland!
 Ah!
 Weland.
 This man here hit him.
 She is a daughter, not a son.
 Unloved and, in truth, banished to Mercia to spend her life being humped by her husband, whom you have so generously put to bed.
 But like her husband, Alfred's not minded to pay a great sum.
 Alfred's price is what?
 Say it!
 I will.
 Separate from the 100lb weight of silver offered by her husband, Alfred will add another 200lb weight of silver.
 300lb in total.
 A good price.
 The daughter of a Frankish king was once bargained for a similar price.
 Pyrlig?
 This is true, Lord, it is a good price.
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
 No, Alfred is not a Frankish king and it is not a good price.
 I say it's a good price.
 Like the pig's arse, you have farted.
 HE BREAKS WIND, LAUGHTER Yes!
 And it stinks, by the gods does it stink.
 Open the doors.
 It is a good price?
 I think it's a good price.
 You insult me!
 If Alfred is minded to offer so little, then I am minded to bring her into this hall and allow each man here take his turn!
 I swear she will be tied to a cart and she will travel the kingdoms.
 Is that what you want, Saxon?
 Do not insult me.
 I'm not insulting you.
 Do not.
 The King has given me some discretion to increase the price.
 What a surprise!
 So, say it.
 Lord, if I may, and to save both time and ink, perhaps YOU might name a price?
 An acceptable price, not an impossible price.
 Say it.
 10,000lb weight of silver and 1,000lb weight of gold.
 Delivered by Alfred himself.
 Of course.
 And he shall arrive with a stoat upon his head and an apple in his mouth.
 With respect, Sigefrid, you fart louder and longer than the pig's arse and I together.
 I need to take a piss.
 It's going to be a long day.
 HE CLEARS THROA HE GROANS PIGS GRUN HE GASPS LAUGHTER LAUGHTER Aethelred, Lord of Mercia!
 If your jaw is not broken, join us!
 Eat.
 Yes.
 I will.
 I would enjoy that.
 Business is done.
 Done?!
 A bargain has been made, and not a good one.
 Say nothing.
 Uhtred and Father Pyrlig have gone to see how your lady is, Lord.
 Then I will go to her.
 No!
 You will wait here.
 You will sit with me.
 To silver and gold.
 And lots of it, Lord.
 Drink.
 THUNDER RUMBLES She's praying.
 Give her time with the priest and then you will see her.
 26 ships.
 By the next moon there will be more.
 And more still, the moon after.
 Alfred will pay for his own destruction.
 You should not underestimate Alfred of Wessex.
 Never.
 But he will pay what you have agreed?
 He will.
 Even for an unloved daughter?
 Alfred is suffering.
 He loves her dearly.
 Her husband does not.
 I was surprised at your anger towards Aethelred.
 What purpose did it serve?
 It was a mistake.
 It was.
 You made it clear that you care for her.
 I cannot let her go.
 I cannot give her up.
 We have just settled on a price, there is agreement.
 With my brother.
 DOOR OPENS Lord Uhtred.
 Lady.
 Your father sends his affection.
 He will be sleeping at the altar, I'm sure.
 I have arranged your release.
 You will soon be coming home.
 Have you spoken with Erik?
 I have.
 What has he told you?
 Lady, he's a Northman and a pagan.
 He is a pagan as YOU are a pagan.
 Any hope that you have of a life together is nonsense.
 It will fail!
 It will not.
 Merely because it's what you wish for?
 Lady, it can never happen.
 Well, it must.
 What of your husband?
 I will not talk of my husband.
 I do not care for him.
 And I will never care for him.
 But he will not stand by.
 I do not care.
 Sigefrid will not stand by, and your father will not stand by!
 You will lose your entire family!
 I will make a family.
 We will make a family, Erik and I.
 And they will die!
 As you will die.
 In a fire, at the tip of a sword Then, I will die happily.
 Aethelflaed, hear me.
 There will be no rest.
 None.
 A life with Erik is what I want.
 It is best for me and it is best for Wessex.
 I can say this to no-one but you.
 I can ask no-one but you.
 Will you help us escape?
 Lady, I am sworn to your father.
 If I help you and succeed, he'll have me killed, but more than that, you are asking me to sanction your own death.
 No, what I am asking is for you to allow me to live!
 I will not be the treasure that builds an army against my father.
 That will not happen.
 Never.
 I will leave this place with Erik or I will not leave at all.
 Uhtred, I am asking you to save my life and with it the nations of Wessex and Mercia.
 Will you help me?
 Please?

SEASON: 02
EPISODE: 06
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
l am Uhtred, son of Uhtred, I have sworn my sword to Alfred and defeated Sigefrid and Erik.
 But the brothers returned from banishment and have taken Lunden.
 Alfred sent a priest to negotiate with the Northmen Father Pyrlig was once a warrior himself.
 While continuing his mission to be king of all of the English.
 I'm to be married?
 Which one of you is Aethelred?
 From what I know, Alfred could not have chosen a bigger turd.
 Having, at last, freed my sister, Thyra, my friend Beocca found love.
 l fear you have become someone I cannot live without.
 Fear no more.
 Whereas I found myself talking to the dead and wanting to believe every word that he spoke.
 He said that I should be King of Wessex and that you, you should be a king, too.
 King of Mercia.
 King of Saxon AND Dane.
 What we have just witnessed, you believe it to be true?
 Now, I must decide where my loyalties lie.
 Do not forget you were raised as a Dane.
 Destiny is all!
 You've barely washed, woman!
 You've been living with Saxons for too long!
 How can I wash in dirty waters?
 The water is good.
 We're a long way from the city.
 
 
 We will be late for the wedding.
 I've been thinking about the man in the grave, Bjorn.
 Uhtred, no You would not like to be a queen?
 Of Bebbanburg, yes.
 
 Let us just enjoy an early morning.
 The two of us.
 
 
 And a hunting party.
 Who is it?
 It's Aethelred.
 The Lord of Mercia.
 Uhtred of Bebbanburg!
 Word has been that you were missing.
 Aethelred.
 I see you managed to remove your head from the King's arse.
 Well, for the moment He's sleeping.
 
 The King has questions about your loyalty It's his way.
 And he tells me that you've been associating with those heathen Danes.
 Like this one, here.
 
 Uhtred, we are needed elsewhere.
 Is he required between your legs, my dear?
 
 
 
 At ease, men.
 You wouldn't dare.
 What, take your nose?
 I think I might Uhtred, we are needed.
 Lord Uhtred, you will let Lord Aethelred go.
 Please.
 Lady, on behalf of my lord, I apologise.
 He does not!
 No?
 There can be no bloodshed here.
 We are all mistaken and we are all proud.
 What men say is true.
 You behave as if you were still at your mother's tit.
 You will learn respect one day, I'm sure.
 Lord It is over, is it not?
 It is!
 I have the King's trust!
 That's a warning!
 I want him dead.
 Too soon.
 I'm sure Alfred would prefer him dead at times, 
 but he knows his value.
 He's nothing but a heathen.
 Uhtred kills Danes.
 He kills Danes, he survives slavery.
 He saves the life of children and mice, no doubt.
 Even my wife-to-be sings his praises Leave us.
 I do not like him and he doesn't like me.
 From the moment that we met.
 You are a threat, lord.
 And he is the same.
 Our hope lies in Daneland.
 With luck, the unrest will grow.
 Peace is not in their nature.
 You wish for war, Aldhelm?
 As a Mercian, lord, what I wish is for Aethelred to be crowned King of Mercia.
 And then, of Wessex.
 Why not?
 It is Alfred we want dead and for that to happen sooner, we will require war.
 How do we look?
 As royalty.
 Aethelflaed is a fortunate young woman.
 I am witness.
 You are together, never to part, bound as man and his wife.
 And a prayer?
 I don't know any prayers!
 
 I will say a prayer.
 Hild.
 Please.
 Let us pray that God and all his saints and all his angels in Heaven, smile and bless you.
 Let us pray that this union of Dane and Saxon can show that this is a land for all people.
 Under one God.
 Under one God, of course.
 Amen.
 Amen.
 When are you going to tell him what Sihtric saw?
 That the ghost is a lie.
 If I tell him, he'll talk.
 And Sigefrid will hear.
 They must believe that we believe.
 I do enjoy another wedding.
 A royal wedding, in particular.
 It is a tonic for the soul.
 The excitement, the expense Aethelwold, I'm still undecided, so do not mention talking corpses.
 Nobles have travelled across the sea, from as far as Frankia, solely to see the beautiful Aethelflaed marry this pretty bread-pudding of a boy.
 A fair description.
 Furthermore, he gets to hump the King's daughter all night long.
 Aethelwold, you will be quiet.
 It is the truth.
 You will be quiet.
 Or you will do what, Irishman?
 kill you in your sleep.
 
 She is so beautiful.
 She is too good for him.
 Why ARE we delaying?
 Did Sihtric witness something at the grave-side Sihtric saw nothing.
 
 May I say that you look quite beautiful.
 God looks upon me with favour I do not deserve.
 Lord God in your heaven, we are humbly gathered before you on this day of thanks and celebration.
 
If you don't mind!
 
 The point I make is simple: all of the power, all of the wealth, all of the land that could belong to you, will now belong to him.
 Should I hit him?
 Yes!
 Yes, by all means, strike me.
 But in your heart, in your purse, you know I speak the truth.
 Yes, hit him.
 
 All I will say, again, is that the dead man speaks the truth 
 Lord?
 Some would say it's treason.
 No, no, this wedding is treason 
 Lord?
 This wedding is a betrayal of Wessex and the men of Wessex.
 Meaning you?
 Should the King die, I have a strong and rightful claim.
 Now, Alfred is working to make a new line of succession 
 Excuse me, Lord Uhtred.
 Go away.
 I am Osferth.
 You are a monk, a baby monk.
 Go, away.
 Lord, you You knew my uncle, lord.
 His name was Leofric.
 Leofric was a great man.
 You are Alfred's bastard son.
 No, but I I wish to join you, lord.
 Be by your side as my uncle was.
 No, we have no need of a monk.
 As a warrior.
 Lord, I wish to serve you as a warrior.
 Uhtred?
 Uhtred, you are wanted.
 The King!
 Enjoy the wedding feast.
 You!
 Find me again.
 Bring a sword and lose your cross.
 Thank you, my lord.
 I will 
 Lord.
 Lord.
 You were seen.
 Seen where, lord?
 Leaving Winchester.
 Leaving Wessex, entering Saxon Mercia and crossing Watling Street.
 Going into Daneland, Uhtred.
 I'm sure you have an explanation.
 I trust we will hear the truth of it.
 What business do you have in Daneland?
 The King's business.
 Lord, your business.
 You're happy for me to speak in this company?
 Freely, why not?
 Lunden has been taken, by the Northmen, Sigefrid and Erik.
 Never!
 Says who?
 Did my lips not move?
 Sigefrid and Erik are in Frankia.
 They were, and now they are not, lord.
 They have a fleet at Beamfleot, they have an army at Beamfleot, some of which has sailed upriver and taken Lunden.
 IF this is true, it cannot be allowed.
 Lunden belongs to Mercia.
 They will choke the river.
 They will, lord.
 With respect, Lord Uhtred.
 You have still not explained why you crossed the street into Daneland.
 I can never remember your name.
 I am Aldhelm, I'm Commander of Lord Aethelred's household guard.
 Would you like me to write it down?
 You will answer, Uhtred.
 I was invited to Daneland, lady, to Padintune.
 And there, I was asked to join with Sigefrid and Erik.
 I was offered the Kingdom of Mercia.
 And your response?
 He is here, is he not?
 I would say that is response enough.
 Uhtred, I did not see you at the church, I do hope you were there.
 I was there, lady.
 of course I was.
 And may I say how beautiful you are today.
 Thank you.
 My dear, we're discussing a matter of importance.
 Yes, I heard, lord.
 So, are the Northmen intending to remain in Lunden or are they waiting for a ransom?
 Fair question.
 Besides Uhtred's loyalties, it is the only question.
 We shall offer negotiations.
 Quite right.
 Once the celebrations are done, you, together with Aethelred, shall travel to Lunden.
 At the very least, you can assess their strength and their numbers.
 An excellent way forward, lord.
 Though if you had killed these brothers in Northumbria, this event could not have occurred.
 Lord King, may I ask what bargain was struck in Northumbria?
 To allow the brothers to leave with their lives?
 Uhtred has told me this story.
 He defeated Sigefrid in combat but spared him on the condition they leave.
 He did this to preserve the lives of his own men.
 It is called negotiation, Lord Aldhelm.
 And now, we suffer the consequences of this negotiation.
 Decisions are made and consequences follow.
 It is the way.
 Our task is to deal with the present.
 To your wisdom, lord.
 
 
 My dear.
 It's not your place to involve yourself in a conversation that became an informal Witan.
 We were discussing matters of land and war.
 Lord, I take an interest in these matters, my father has always encouraged You are no longer the King's daughter.
 You are my wife.
 It's me you will obey.
 You are delicate.
 I find it interesting.
 I would speak with the King often You're of Mercia now.
 You are my queen.
 And you think you're a king?
 I call you queen because you mean that much to me.
 I do not like your tone nor accusation.
 What I would like is you, on your belly on the bed.
 Lord?
 Your husband wishes to ride you.
 You will lie on your belly.
 What's this?
 Disobedience?
It's confusion, lord.
 Should I hand you back to Wessex?
 Unused, but tarnished?
 You wouldn't dare.
 We shall see.
 Lord!
 I am your wife.
 
 
 
 A good day.
 It was.
 Though I'm glad it's over.
 Lord!
 If I may have a brief word?
 Lady, it will take just a moment.
 Be sure it does, Odda.
 The King is tired.
 Lord I fear that you undervalue Uhtred.
 He is by far our most accomplished warrior and has been nothing but loyal Odda, we have discussed this many times.
 He is sworn and yet he continues to behave as if he were his own man.
 He is a little reckless at times, yes Uhtred crosses into Daneland without advising you or I first!
 I tolerate this behaviour only because he is our most accomplished warrior.
 But if he had not crossed the street, lord, we would not know of the fall of Lunden Do not doubt, for one moment, Uhtred Ragnarson has ambition.
 He will have been tempted by this offer from the Northmen.
 And yet, he is here, lord.
 Doing what?
 Spying?
 Waiting?
 Did he volunteer this information before being confronted?
 No, he did not.
 No, lord Ask yourself why.
 I have said many times he is a sword I would rather wield than face but he is not godly and never shall be.
 I wish you a good night's rest, Odda, you are clearly in need of it.
 What troubles you, Brother?
 Uhtred, he doubts the dead man.
 You believe so?
 Yes.
 We should have approached him man-on-man, with honour.
 You think he knows it is a trick?
 Yes.
 Maybe.
 You don't know.
 
 No.
 
 Ah.
 
 How's the pain?
 The same.
 Constant.
 It reminds me I am alive.
 That I should live.
 If Uhtred knows that Bjorn is a lie then he will come, with Alfred's army.
 Yes.
 So, I get to kill him after all.
 
 If we wish, there is a way to raise the greatest army these shores have ever seen.
 It can be done.
 The Temes River would be dark with ships, Danes and Northmen.
 All we need to be is clever and patient.
 Patient?
 
 Oh, there will still be blood to spill, Brother.
 But this way, we can be Kings of it all.
 No Guthrun.
 No Aethelred.
 No Alfred.
 No Uhtred.
 They say Lunden is dangerous.
 Oh, it is, but Lunden is alive with every kind of life.
 I hear women do not walk the streets unguarded, that bodies are found in the river daily.
 Twice daily, with each and every tide.
 Lunden is not Winchester, but one year here is worth ten elsewhere.
 Then why do you not live here?
 And end up dead in the river?
 Do I look like a fool?
 
 What's to stop them from cutting our throats and siding with the Northmen?
 I've been pondering the same.
 The answer is that you are Alfred's son-in-law now.
 
 
 Uhtred, how is it that you know these streets so well?
 I stayed here for a time, with Earl Ragnar the Fearless, when I was a boy.
 When you were a Dane?
 As you can see, the one fact in our favour is that the whole of Lunden cannot be defended, it's too big.
 Even the walls surrounding the old Roman city would need many hundreds of men.
 So, the brothers' position is weak?
 Not weak, but Lunden's been open to all tribes for a reason.
 The ground's not far now.
 I shall speak.
 You should ask for food and ale, lord, my belly believes my throat is cut.
 
 
 I do not understand how this kills a man.
 Sigefrid, take his head and be done with it.
 No, no.
 No, no, no.
 I want to know how.
 The cross kills a man slowly, lord, over days.
 It is both torture and execution.
 Unlike Saxons and Danes, the Romans were clever.
 There, you have your answer.
 Now take his head off.
 Agreed, lord, and if you please, when it comes to me, with your sharpest axe and strongest man.
 You talk too much.
 I do, you should kill me swiftly.
 God preserve us It is a death.
 Nothing more.
 Lords!
 It is Uhtred.
 Uhtred Ragnarson!
 The future King of Mercia!
 Welcome to Lunden, your new home, should you want it.
 Sigefrid.
 I thought you might want to kill me still.
 0h, for a long time, I did.
 But then, I grew to like my new hand.
 Though I have to be careful when wiping my arse.
 
 It is good to see you here, Uhtred.
 Though your friends are not familiar.
 This is Aethelred of Mercia.
 Lord.
 My spies tell me you are to marry Alfred's daughter.
 Your spies are wrong, lord.
 I've already married Alfred's daughter.
 Oh, how does she ride?
 I've no complaint.
 Uhtred, why is he here?
 I am here, lords, to ask of you your price, for leaving Lunden.
 Alfred wishes to negotiate.
 I wish to negotiate.
 We have only just arrived, why would we want to leave?
 You're warriors, you will know that Lunden is impossible to defend, so let's get this done.
 Is that a threat?
 Your price?
 It sounds like a threat.
 I'm asking you to retreat, lords, for a price, for silver.
 Flesh is our price.
 Your bride, Aethelflaed.
 Nonsense.
 She has great beauty, a good mind.
 I am in need of a wife.
 I am in need of a hump, we will share her.
 She is my wife.
 Aethelred, they're teasing you.
 Perhaps we can begin with a cup of ale?
 It's a long walk from the river.
 A cup of ale it is, Lord Uhtred.
 Do you have food, lord?
 The bread is stale, but good.
 I have been told that you saw the dead man rise.
 I did.
 And you heard him speak?
 Of a good plan, yes.
 Could you guarantee Ragnar?
 And all the men he commands?
 Are you with us?
 I'm here.
 Yes, but are you here for Alfred or yourself or us?
 Ragnar's in the north.
 It would take some time for news to reach him, more time for him to decide.
 I guarantee nothing, lord.
 Your prisoners are from where?
 They are from Guthrum's arse.
 The Earl Guthrum is called Aethelstan now.
 Guthrum is a shit stain.
 He sends priests to Beamfleot, begging for peace, begging for warriors to settle and do what?
 Raise sheep?
 Many men do, lord.
 There are no sheep farmers in Valhalla.
 Do you intend to put all the priests on the cross?
 It is Sigefrid's game.
 I do not understand how it kills a man 
 Slowly, lord.
 It's a cruel death.
 That's what the priest there said.
 The priest is right.
 The priest looks like a pale bag of bones and dough.
 You should let him fight.
 The Romans used this square forjust that purpose.
 Combat.
 He would die too easily.
 Give him something to fight for his freedom.
 Why?
 I'd rather watch him spill his guts than nailed to a piece of wood.
 Where's the fun in that?
 
 Boltan!
 We need to be entertained!
 Are you man enough to kill a priest?
 
 
 I'm almost ready.
 Pointy end forward, is it?
 So, when I kill him, I'm allowed to go free, that is the bargain?
 That is the bargain.
 Hear that, Boltan?
 He plans to kill you!
 I do.
 Beware.
 I am afraid, lord.
 Spare me this trial, I beg you.
 
 
 
 Get up, priest.
 Finish him!
 
 
 Now I do not wish to kill this idiot, as I'm sure his mother loves him.
 But do I have your word, as warriors, that I am now a free man?
 You have my word, priest.
 If all your men fight like this, Alfred will have no trouble throwing you out of Lunden.
 Put down your sword.
 Thank you, lord.
 It was a bit on the heavy side.
 
 Where have you learnt to fight, priest?
 The monastery?
 I'm a Briton, lord.
 I was brought up killing Saxons.
 Then join us, join me.
 Ten years ago maybe.
 But now, I will fight for my God 
 and my freedom, it seems!
 If it is acceptable, I will return with the Lord Uhtred.
 But not before we've settled on a price.
 I hope?
 How much for you to leave Lunden?
 I find it disturbing that they will not consider silver.
 Why should they?
 The longer Wessex is without trade, the greater the worth of Lunden.
 You were able to assess their strength?
 Your priest, Pyrlig, says they have up to one thousand men, lord.
 We can muster three times that number, lord, easily.
 Lunden is not a field, it won't be a simple question of numbers.
 Of course, it is a question of numbers, it'll be a siege.
 The more men that we have, the greater the chance of success.
 Regardless of how many die?
 It'll be men climbing ladders, it can only succeed with numbers and with death.
 I will not lose men for the sake of too little thought.
 There must be a clear plan.
 Then let us hear this clear plan.
 We attack one gate with a substantial army, allowing smaller groups to enter through a second gate, a third gate, even.
 Attacking from land?
 Yes, from land.
 Not the river?
 No, lord.
 The river is worth considering, lord.
 It would be counter to their thinking.
 There is a gate close to the river?
 Yes, lord.
 It's called Ludd Gate.
 Perfect.
 Silent oars, the cover of darkness, the advantage of surprise.
 The river runs fast at Ludd Gate, making it impossible to land men safely.
 But if the Lord of Mercia believes that men sinking to the bottom of the river is an advantage, then let him attack.
 Uhtred, your advice may well be sound, but how am I to trust it?
 Lord?
 Why do the brothers call you the next "Lord of Mercia"?
 They call me the next 'King of Mercia", lord.
 Why?
 Why do they call you "King"?
 What has been said, Uhtred?
 What has been agreed?
 Nothing has been agreed.
 How am I to trust you?!
 Lord, I am weary of this YOU are weary of this!?
 You say you are sworn, yet you behave like a spy!
 You float into Daneland and back again, you tell half-truths, keep secrets and you refuse to accept the existence of the one, true God!
 You serve your king reluctantly!
 But I serve, lord!
 I do not know you!
 And I can never know you, I I do not understand you.
 And I will never understand you that is a fact, and one of increasing concern.
 And on top of this, my enemies now call you "King".
 And they called you a weasel, lord.
 Neither is true.
 Impossible.
 We must devise a plan of attack.
 Uhtred, you will leave us.
 You will leave.
 Oh, I will be happy to.
 Should you need me further, you will find me at the Two Cranes lnn.
 Lord, with the greatest respect, the insolence we have witnessed cannot go unpunished.
 With the greatest respect, it is not your business, 
 it is the business of Wessex!
 Uhtred is to return to Coccham.
 Lord, we are on the cusp of war, you will need your best warriors.
 Uhtred is to return to Coccham.
 Then I will go to the Two Cranes lnn and inform him, personally.
 As you wish.
 You will return to Mercia and gather men, a thousand 
 Wessex will match it.
 Yes, lord.
 My exact written instruction shall follow.
 I want Sigefrid and Erik out of Lunden and soon.
 It will be done, lord.
 Thank you, lord.
 Steapa.
 Lord?
 Do you trust the Ealdorman, Uhtred?
 With my life, lord.
 
 He believes I drink too much.
 And I do, of late.
 It's the taste, lord.
 It is the effect.
 I'm getting old, Uhtred.
 I'm getting old, with no son to follow me.
 It is as though my time has been wasted.
 No, lord.
 Never!
 Promise me you won't desert him.
 Not yet, at least.
 I'm not an oath-breaker.
 How can I serve a man who doesn't trust me?!
 To whom I have given so much?
 All he can see is how I'm different.
 All I see in him is his piety.
 He's a man I am beginning to despise.
 I asked and all that came was further doubt.
 I am growing Wessex.
 I am reaching out for an England, all in the name of God.
 Yet I am relying upon the strength of a heathen, the iron of a pagan.
 It does not fit, lord.
 It does not.
 What if all this time, it has been the work of the Devil tempting me?
 Offering me this warrior, this seemingly loyal and brave man, who piece by small piece, is eating at my soul and clouding what I believe to be right and wrong.
 Lord King this is what the Devil would do.
 But, I swear, your soul has not diminished.
 I would have seen it.
 Uhtred will not change, I'm sure, He'll be heathen till his death.
 But nor will you change.
 Your faith is one that will grow stronger.
 You are God's king, lord.
 Yet at my right hand is a pagan.
 Do you trust him wholly?
 I do not.
 I cannot.
 Then be rid of him.
 Lord.
 In my hand, I have a letter from Alfred of Wessex!
 It is the promise of one thousand men!
 
 It is the one thousand men demanded by our lord, Aethelred of Mercia, to fight alongside the great fryd of Mercia to help rid Lunden of the filthy, stinking, pox-ridden, pig's-arse ugly, heathen, Danish bastards!
 
 A toast!
 
 A toast!
 To the warriors of Mercia.
 Where we go, Alfred and Wessex shall follow.
 And we shall rise!
 We shall rise!
 
 To Mercia!
 
 To Mercia!
 You're eating like a little bird.
 Peck, peck, peck.
 I have no appetite.
 Tomorrow we ride.
 I would like you to travel with me.
 To battle?
 Part of the way.
 Or would you rather not?
 No, no, lord, I would like to go.
 Then eat.
 For strength.
 Out.
 All of you, out.
 
 You have the palest of skin.
 Unblemished.
 My touch offends you?
 No, it was a surprise, lord, nothing more than that.
 Lord, love should be gentle and kind.
 "Gentle and kind," she says.
 How is it that you have a knowledge of how love should be?
 I do not.
 Am I not the first?
 You will not insult me And you will not offer me lessons on how to plough a field!
 That is not what I was doing.
 Who is it that you've been with?
 How many have you been with?!
 Lord, please Uhtred is one, is he not?
 You have no right to speak to me in this way!
 Of course, I have a right!
 You are my wife!
 I am Aethelflaed of Wessex!
 And you will not treat me like I am a servant girl!
 Do not!
 
 
 
 Do not, never raise your shrill voice to me!
 
 You will see a priest and we shall find the truth of this.
 This is not love, that is the truth of it.
 You will see a priest!
 Father Beocca!
 I would like to speak with you.
 About prayer.
 This must go no further.
 I fear that I am not the first with my wife.
 The first, lord?
 To lie with her, to bed her.
 Oh.
 I see.
 But she is the King's daughter.
 I need it proven.
 Have you asked her, lord, directly?
 I need to know the truth of it.
 Is there a way to test her word?
 Lord, she is Aethelflaed.
 Do I go to another priest, Father?
 A stranger to my wife?
 Lord Aethelred!
 Welcome to Coccham!
 The jewel of Wessex.
 Uhtred is expecting you.
 There is a way, lord, from the holy books.
 Then do it.
 Uhtred is with the women, lord, helping them prepare food.
 Such is the life of a banished warrior.
 I have not seen the inside of a pagan hall.
 I am surprised at its warmth.
 Were you expecting to see heads on poles, lord?
 I was, lady.
 Excuse my ignorance.
 I will excuse you, this one time.
 Will Lady Aethelflaed be joining us after prayers, lord?
 If she has the will, yes.
 She has not travelled well.
 Should she be travelling at all to battle?
 It was her wish to accompany her husband.
 They are newly married, after all.
 She will be kept out of harm's way.
 Uhtred, has the King written that when the siege of Lunden begins, I am to be first up the ladder?
 It is, after all, something you would do.
 You accept that I am in charge, of all men.
 It's the King's wish.
 It is.
 Oh, dear You are with us?
 Why would I not be?
 I am an Ealdorman of Wessex.
 Alfred has decided to give you this one last chance.
 Do you have a plan?
 Together, we will travel downriver, meet with the armies of Mercia and Wessex, make camp a short distance from Lunden.
 Do you have a plan of attack?
 Yes.
 It is not too dissimilar from your plan.
 You will attack the north gate with your own men.
 Once the assault is underway, I shall attack from the marshes with the main army.
 And how will you know my assault is underway?
 I will know.
 You will know Uhtred, do not doubt me, I want this victory.
 Lunden belongs to Mercia and I am Lord of Mercia.
 I will go with every man at my disposal, to reclaim what is mine.
 Good.
 I am with Uhtred.
 No Steapa, you're with me.
 I am with Uhtred.
 The King says.
 Very well.
 I am with Steapa, behind Steapa.
 Your bravery knows no beginning, Aethelwold.
 A toast!
 To the Mercians who died for Wessex at Ethandun.
 And to the men of Wessex who will fight for Mercia at Lunden.
 To allies.
 To allies.
 
 
 This is the Word of the Lord.
 If a man fears that his wife has been unfaithful l have not.
 He shall bring her before a priest, who shall prepare the bitter waters.
 A mixture of God's water and God's earth shall be drunk.
 Know this, if thou hast gone aside to another man, the Lord shall make thy thigh to rot and thy belly to swell.
 Amen.
 Amen.
 Child you will now drink the bitter waters.
 
 This will not be necessary.
 You are pure and may God strike me down this very instant if you are not.
 
 Does he beat you?
 If he does not, then he will.
 I can see it.
 He is not, er tender or loving.
 Father Beocca, you must tell the King.
 No!
 You cannot.
 The King is the only man who can end it.
 God put an end to this ordeal before it had begun.
 Not all in Mercia are friends of Wessex.
 Not all are happy with the King's influence.
 And I must do my duty to Alfred.
 My husband will not break me.
 You must not tell anyone what has happened here.
 
 You're quiet today, Father Beocca.
 A sleepless night.
 Should I speak with Thyra?
 Tell her you need your rest?
 You shall do no such thing!
 You will not talk of such matters.
 And what matters are those, Father?
 I've said enough.
 You've ALL said ENOUGH!
 
 Lords!
 They have set up their camp no more than a mile away.
 Then we get this done.
 Tofi!
 The fire must smoke, black smoke!
 Yes, lord, there will be smoke.
 Every man on his feet!
 [Haesten] Up!
 We must be ready!
 You all know what needs to be done!
 We cannot fail!
 Go!
 
 We cannot fail!
 
 
 It's open.
 Do you see a guard?
 None.
 I see a trap.
 Yes, of course, if it is a trap, we should walk towards it.
 Hey!
 Shush your mouth.
 
 
 Hey!
 Inside!
 If you want to live, stay inside!
 
 Any idea what's happening?
 None.
 Shield wall!
 
 Aethelred?
 Aethelred!
 Uhtred?
 We've seen not a single man!
 Same!
 Then they have fled?
 It is our numbers, lord.
 They fear our numbers.
 Move!
 Move!
 They fear us!
 The city is ours!
 
 No!
 No!
 No!
 Keep the formation!
 
 Keep your formation!
 
 Lord!
 [man] fire!
 fire!
 I see fire up there!
 Stand ready!
 It's a signal!
 It's a signal, no doubt, lord.
 They will come.
 
 It's a signal that can be seen from a mile or more.
 Aethelred!
 Aethelred!
 
 Move!
 Move!
 Aethelred!
 The camp!
 Thyra!
 
 
 Death Death is coming.
 Death is coming.
 
 Death is coming!
 
 Wake up!
 WAKE UP!
 DEATH IS COMING!
 Wake up!
 
 Wake up!
 Take up your swords!
 
 WAKE UP!
 
 DEATH IS COMING!
 Aethelflaed is to be protected!
 With your lives!
 For God and for the King!
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 This way!
 
 
 Aethelflaed!
 Aethelflaed!
 Thyra!
 AETHELFLAED!
 She's there!
 
 The forest!
 Thyra!
 
 
 This way!
 
 Aethelflaed, let go of my hand!
 Run!
 RUN!

SEASON: 02
EPISODE: 05
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred.
 Defeated at Ethandun, Earl Guthrum was baptised and became King Aethelstan of East Anglia.
 While in Wessex, Aethelwold still sees himself as the true heir to the throne.
 I see it as a king would see it.
 Yet, King Alfred has other plans.
 I am to be married?
 A permanent bond between Wessex and Mercia.
 Which one of you is Aethelred?
 Alfred forced me to renew my allegiance.
 He sent me to kill the Northmen brothers, Erik and Sigefrid.
 Argh!
 Aah!
 After taking Sigefrid's hand, I banished them.
 You will take one ship and you will leave Northumbria.
 You will not return.
 I swear.
 And at last, in Northumbria, I took my revenge against Kjartan and his son, Sven, freeing my enslaved sister, Thyra.
 Let me help you.
 Having defeated the Danes, I married my love, Gisela.
 And now all seems quiet.
 But for a warrior there can never be peace.
 Destiny is all.
 We're here.
 Ground herahead.
 And be ready.
 She says she loves me.
 
 I swear!
 She says she loves me.
 [Finan] She would.
 Sihtric, she's a whore.
 No!
 She's past that.
 What she loves is your silver.
 Is that the name of his cock?
 
 I wish to marry her.
 And I wish you to kill Danes and survive the night.
 We're the only chance the villagers have.
 
 They have begun.
 
 
 Elgin, pass me the flask.
 Ah 
 
 If you wish to live, boy, take your hand away from your sword.
 Yah!
 Aah!
 There will be no more than 30 raiders.
 We hide and we wait.
 We attack on my command, not before.
 You all heard the Lord.
 We find cover.
 [man] Keep them moving.
 Be quiet, woman!
 
 Don't look at me!
 Come on, come on!
 Stay together.
 That's enough.
 You're alive, girl, be thankful.
 Elgin!
 Elgin, get up!
 You can help rope the prisoners.
 And keep them quiet!
 
 Elgin!
 
 Are you drunk?
 Now!
 
 [Finan] We kill every bastard one of them!
 [man] To arms!
 Defend yourselves!
 WO[man] Run!
 Argh!
 
 
 What's your name?
 Her name is Aethelflaed, Lord.
 You're her mother?
 No, Lord.
 King Alfred He has a daughter named Aethelflaed.
 She's strong and brave.
 You will need to be the same.
 Go back to your village and take care of your dead.
 
 Finan?
 Hang three of the dead from the trees visible from the river.
 Lord.
 
 Take back what belongs to you.
 You're safe now.
 You will go back to your rat's nest and tell anyone who cares to listen Beyond Lunden, the River Temes belongs to Alfred.
 And it's guarded by Uhtred of Bebbanburg.
 Now there's a welcome sight My wife and my boy!
 Whoa!
 Oh-ho!
 I think we might be feeding you too much.
 Don't forget your daughter, she's here too.
 It went well?
 It did, not a scratch.
 You have a visitor.
 He has been here all night.
 
 Aethelwold.
 How much of my ale have you drunk?
 Not a cup.
 Not a drop of ale has passed my lips for ten days or more.
 You've been ill?
 Not ill, but sober.
 Which, as you know, is unlike me.
 But it is important that you accept that I am sober.
 
 Say what you're here to say, you have waited long enough.
 The dead speak.
 I have seen it, heard it and the dead speak.
 The dead?
 A corpse.
 I saw him rise from his grave and speak.
 And what did this corpse say?
 Well, what he said concerns us both, us all, hence my visit, and what I tell you are his words, not mine, you understand?
 And what did he say?
 That I should be King.
 No, believe me, it is true.
 He said that I should be King of Wessex and that you, you should be a king too.
 He said that you, Uhtred, will be crowned King of Mercia.
 Bjorn heard it through the three spinners.
 Bjorn?
 That is his name.
 He is a Dane?
 A dead Dane, yes.
 And therefore, a good Dane.
 We are royalty, you and l.
 I have done my utmost to serve Alfred, but with no reward, no respon Where are you going?
 To wash the blood off my hands and then to bed!
 Do you not believe me?
 Where did you see this corpse?
 Mercia.
 Beyond Watling Street.
 You crossed into Daneland?
 I went to the part of Mercia that Alfred gifted to the Danes, yes.
 You happened to wander across Watling Street?
 I was sent for!
 I was invited!
 And the same will happen to you.
 
 I know what I saw.
 You will be a queen.
 I may not wish to be a queen.
 When Bjorn is ready to speak, there will be a messenger.
 Tell me Do you wish Alfred harm?
 No.
 No, of course not.
 I mean, I wish him dead, but I would not harm him.
 I know what I saw.
 I will not outstay my welcome.
 Thank you for your kindness.
 You are sworn to Alfred.
 To become King of Mercia you would need to break that oath.
 If that is my fate.
 Then you believe he speaks the truth?
 No, I do not.
 But I know he's not telling lies.
 The truth is another matter.
 We do not want an enemy such as Alfred.
 And Alfred will not want an enemy like me.
 
 There appears to be good progress, Lord.
 The people of Coccham seem to be in good spirits.
 It would appear so.
 WO[man] Welcome, Lord King.
 We shall see.
Lord King.
  Open the gates!
 Finan.
 What?
 Lord King!
 Welcome to Coccham.
 Finan.
 Lord Uhtred is at the fortress, the burh.
 Would you fetch him, Finan?
 We'll be waiting in the hall.
 I will, Lord.
 The man must have a priest for each day of the year.
  God be with you.
 Lord, we are crossing into Wessex.
 This stretch of river is protected by Lord Uhtred.
 You say you have trade there?
 I do, Lord.
 Lord, please, I cannot risk losing my ship.
 You will KEEP your ship.
 It's easy enough to say it.
 It is a pagan's hall.
 Lord, you say the same every time we visit.
 Uhtred IS a pagan, as is his hall.
 I find it annoying that he will not grow.
 He insists upon clinging to these ancient beliefs.
 The beliefs of our forefathers.
 Who knew no better.
 Lord King.
 Refreshment.
 Thank you, Gisela.
 I, uh I trust you are well?
 I am, Lord, and better for your visit.
 The ale is freshly brewed.
 Ah!
 Excellent.
 You are content in Wessex, I hope?
 I am, Lord.
 I am well, my family are well, and there's peace, this is all I ask.
 And what of you?
 Are you content?
 My daughter is now old enough and will soon be gifted in marriage, I am apprehensive.
 Aethelflaed is a sweet girl.
 She is.
 You are fond of her suitor, Lord?
 Aethelred.
 He serves a purpose.
 He is godly.
 Well, we look forward to the wedding celebrations in Winchester.
 And I wish her happiness.
 The purpose of marriage is not to be happy, my dear.
 Then I am fortunate.
 I pray my own wife might say the same!
 Oh, I imagine she does, Odda, she so rarely sees you.
 
 Lord King.
 Lord Odda.
 Steapa, my friend.
 Uhtred, you do not deserve such a charming wife.
 Oh, I can only agree, Lord.
 I was not expecting you, there's been no message.
 I'm hearing you've hanged a man.
 I hanged many men just lately.
 Raiders, Danes And already dead, Lord.
 I'm speaking of a Saxon man, a man of Coccham, of Wessex.
 That is why you're here?
 Amongst other concerns.
 That man was a thief, Lord.
 Sinful to the bone.
 You hanged him without trial.
 He was guilty.
 Three times over.
 It is the purpose of a trial to determine guilt.
 People must witness justice being done.
 Then I shall arrange a trial.
 It's a little bit late for that, I fear.
 Has there been a complaint, Lord?
 There are laws, carefully written laws.
 If you wish to remain an ealdorman, you will adhere to them.
 You shall not impose your pagan ideals within my kingdom.
 We are west of Watling Street, not east.
 Yes, Lord.
 We do not cross over into Daneland, we do not cross over into Danelaw, in mind, nor body, norspirit.
 No, Lord.
 My nephew Aethelwold, he was, uh Well, he was seen doing just that.
 Leaving Wessex, crossing through Mercia from west to east.
 Are you aware of this?
 I am not.
 When Aethelwold was here, he mentioned nothing of crossing into Daneland.
 Hm, what did he mention?
 He mentioned you, Lord, and how you took his crown.
 Aethelwold is permanently idle.
 My advice is the same as it has always been you should put him on trial and then kill him.
 Should the devil begin to whisper in his ear, then I may have no choice.
 
 Besides the man you strung up, how many of the raiders did you kill?
 We killed about 30 men in total.
 They had sacked a village.
 Which was in Mercia.
 Lord, we hear the screams at night.
 Mercia is weak.
 Its people have no protection from the Danes.
 Mercia is disorganised and that will change.
 There will be burhs.
 What is that?
 That structure there?
 It's a place for prayer, Lord.
 A church, Uhtred?
 Not quite, Lord.
 it's a shack, with a cross attached.
 If it is for the purpose of prayer, then it is a church.
 [Clapa] Lord!
 A ship is near.
 Traders.
 Perhaps you'd like a moment to pray, Lord?
 I'll need to watch the trader.
 Yes.
 Yes, I would like that.
 Lord!
 I was just thinking about you.
 You were in my prayers, is what I mean.
 Thank you, Hild.
 Please continue, do not let me disturb your peace.
 Would you care to sit with me?
 In peace, Lord?
 I would, Hild.
 I will.
 May I ask?
 Have you found your lasting peace?
 I am near, Lord.
 I feel more content here with God than with my sword.
 Courage without the sword is the more difficult path.
 It must, in time, become the only path.
 I pray you find your peace sooner than I.
 Thank you, Lord.
 [Godwine] You, stay with the ship.
 Godwine, I was expecting you days ago.
 Are you carrying the axe heads?
 I am, Lord, Frankia-made.
 Would split an oak tree.
 How many?
 How many do you need?
 My man saw warriors aboard your ship.
 Is this true?
 Three men only, Lord.
 It is a Northman.
 He wishes to speak with you.
 Alone.
 Can I trust this Northman?
 He says that you know him.
 His name is Erik, he has a brother, Sigefrid.
 Finan First sign of trouble, fire the ship.
 There'll be no need for fire, Lord.
 Sihtric, fetch me a whole bunch of torches.
 I like to be prepared.
 Uhtred of Bebbanburg.
 Here you are, lost in Wessex once again.
 I am sworn to King Alfred.
 That is why I am here Why are you here?
 I'm not looking to fight.
 Not yet.
 Can you believe I'm travelling to meet with a dead man?
 You deal in sorcery now?
 It is my fate, or so I'm told.
 You have my word that I will make my appointment in Mercia and then I shall return to Frankia.
 Sigefrid is in Frankia?
 He is, but not for much longer.
 My brother is restless.
 We have grown strong in the years since Northumbria.
 We have a fleet now.
 19 ships.
 Which you will sail to where?
 Oh, we have no firm plan, other than to listen to Bjorn.
 The dead man.
 You say it without surprise, Uhtred.
 I think you might have gotten wind of this ghost.
 He speaks the words of the three spinners, we cannot ignore him.
 "We"?
 You and l.
 After his defeat at Ethandun, the Earl Guthrum rejected our gods and they are angry.
 They want a revenge.
 I believe we have been chosen.
 You will receive your invitation, you shall see for yourself, I'm sure.
 What if I refuse to meet with this ghost?
 That is a matter for the three spinners and the gods.
 And what if I believe this ghost to be a trap?
 To be Sigefrid, wanting to kill me?
 You have my word that it is not.
 I swear.
 All that we want is Uhtred of Bebbanburg at our side.
 Now, am I allowed to pass to keep my own appointment?
 You are.
 Safe journey.
 All the way back to Frankia.
 Uhtred Ragnarson You will always have my respect.
 But do not forget you were raised as a Dane.
 
 The broth was suitable, Lord?
 Mm, the broth was a delight, Gisela.
 As is the ale.
 You should moderate, Odda, you have a ladder to climb to find your bed.
 You can always be carried, Lord.
 It wouldn't be the first time!
 
 And I guarantee it won't be the last time.
 Lord, you make me out to be a drunk.
 Though my head will be sore in the morning, I know it.
 Well, then, it's ale for breakfast, Lord!
 The only cure!
 Was my nephew drunk when he was here last?
 Aethelwold is often drunk, Lord.
 But this last time, he did not touch a drop.
 He mentioned he had been sober for days, which came as a surprise.
 That's a miracle!
 Not quite.
 Aethelwold is not a complete fool, Lord.
 If he's idle, then could he not help bring order to Mercia?
 He fought well at Ethandun.
 As he is fond of reminding people.
 He's as good a man as Aethelred.
 Uhtred, you speak of matters you do not understand, matters that do not concern you.
 The safety of Wessex concerns me.
 I'm happy to hear you say it.
 Which is why we killed the raiders, Lord.
 Raiders who once belonged to Earl Guthrum.
 His name is now King Aethelstan.
 That has been his name since he became a Christian.
 Regardless of what he is called, it's his men who now break the peace.
 You are sure of this?
 I am.
 They gather at the mouth of the Temes river at Beamfleot.
 It's true, Lord.
 200 or more, we've seen it.
 And the number grows.
 If these rogues are Aethelstan's men, then they are his worry.
 Until they decide to blockade the river, Lord.
 Then Wessex will be starved of trade.
 Aethelstan shall deal with them.
 He must kill them.
 I believe WE must kill them.
 What we must do is hold the peace.
 war cannot always be the answer.
 Lord, forgive me, but you speak of matters YOU do not fully understand.
 These men will not listen to Aethelstan and Aethelstan will not deal with them.
 For now, they are rogues, but should they find a lord to serve, then they will become an army.
 So answer me this.
 Where might this lord come from?
 Do I know of him?
 Should I fear him?
 You can be sure he will not be called Uhtred, Lord, if that is your meaning.
 My advice, Lord, is to send ships and men to Beamfleot.
 We shall maintain the peace.
 They say it is an honour to have the King stay, but his men and his priests have eaten almost a winter's worth of food.
 Uhtred, how can you serve a man who doesn't see your value?
 Oh, he sees it, but his god won't allow him to embrace it.
 He dislikes me more by the day.
 Then you should ask him to release you and we will go north.
 To my brother and to Ragnar.
 I am content here, but we cannot become an enemy of Alfred.
 Lord!
 Hild.
 You look fearsome.
 
 I think I preferred you with a sword.
 Ah, my sword has become heavy.
 But you could probably kill someone with that, though.
 I need to speak to you plainly.
 I would like to build a house, a nunnery, here in Coccham, but with your permission and that of the bishop, of course.
 The time is the right time.
 You have my permission, no question.
 Thank you.
 And you have my protection.
 Always.
 Abbess Hild.
 You will always be too good a woman for God alone.
 
 Alfred will be pleased.
 [Erik] Stow the oars!
 Make her secure.
 And, Haesten Lord?
 Ensure the ships are guarded well.
 Yes, Lord.
 The fortress of Beamfleot.
 And all the men inside.
 They are ours now.
 Even the air is rich here.
 Lunden is how far up river?
 Half a day, with the tide.
 We take it at the earliest.
 And Uhtred?
 As we planned.
 Looking forward to the wedding, Father?
 I am.
 I am, Father Beocca.
 I enjoy a wedding as much as the next drunkard.
 And how is your own lady, Father, the Dane?
 Thyra?
 She is not my lady.
 She's well.
 She is something of a strange beauty.
 Yes.
 She's, uh She's Yes.
 I inform God each evening how much I miss the company of a woman.
 He sends me nothing.
 We talk, Thyra and l.
 She's a pleasant woman.
 There is no finer sight than that of a naked woman, arms outstretched.
 Almost there.
 Lord?
 Lord?
 [Alfred] Beocca, come in.
 Father Pyrlig.
 Good day, Lord.
 I read of nothing but skirmishes and raids.
 What kind of a place must Daneland be?
 Sinful, Lord.
 Without question.
 They aspire only to kill and fornicate.
 Lord, are we to wait?
 For a moment.
 Lady Aelswith.
 Lady, I'm begging your pardon for my somewhat colourful description of life as a Dane.
 We are prepared, Lord.
 Father Pyrlig, I have a task for you.
 Lord.
 You are familiar with East Anglia, are you not?
 I am, Lord, a land of quite unremarkable beauty.
 You are to go to King Aethelstan.
 He may need help with the reading of this letter.
 Aethelstan.
 He is to deal with the rogue Danes at Beamfleot and swiftly.
 If you could emphasise swiftly.
 Emphasise swiftly.
 You have been allocated a guard.
 They are waiting for you in the stab.
 I am to leave now, Lord?
 Swiftly, Father.
 May I say, I was somewhat looking forward to the celebrations, Lord, the The whole of Winchester shall be celebrating Swiftly.
 Yes, Lord.
 I will gather what I need.
 Lord.
 You are ready?
 I am.
 There is still a little decorative work to be done.
 Now, do not touch it, you have ink on your hands.
 Say what you think.
 Do you like it?
 I have not seen anything so beautiful.
 He does not deserve you.
 Did I not say the same?
 I hope that Aethelred says the same.
 Aethelred should consider himself a very fortunate young man.
 And in time, you will grow fond of him, I'm sure.
 I'm already fond of him.
 0h, shush now, you've barely met him!
 The last time, over a year ago.
 Aethelred is a good and godly man.
 Who is a little too fond of himself.
 Will Uhtred be coming to the wedding?
 Sadly, he will, I'm sure.
 I consider him to be our lucky charm.
 Now, now, there'll be no mention of luck or charms.
 There is God's will and nothing more.
 Praise him.
 [man] Hold the horses.
  Get some water.
 [Aldhelm] It is fertile land, Lord.
 No greener than Mercia.
 Though Wessex does have the advantage of not sharing a border with the Welsh.
 The Welsh to the west, the Danes to the east and Alfred to the south.
 We're surrounded.
 I would say we're perfectly positioned at the very middle of Alfred's idea of an England Pivotal.
 Yes, I like that.
 Lord?
 Lord!
 Have you made a decision yet?
 Have you given it thought?
 Given thought to what?
 Uhtred.
 Well my request to marry, Lord.
 I would like to have a family.
 Lord, you will answer the man.
 I will speak with her at Winchester and give you my decision.
 Thank you, Lord.
 But you are to give her no more of your arm-rings, nor silver!
 If it is not the great Lord Uhtred of the small and little-known village of Coccham.
 I see you're drinking again, Aethelwold.
 It's just a cup or two, nothing more.
 I have news for you.
 You know where to find me.
 Before you take yourself away to an inn, I wish to speak with you.
 About what?
 Privately.
 Uhtred, please.
 Let us not rush to make an enemy of Alfred.
 And if the dead man and the gods say differently?
 They will not, if they are truly gods.
 And also This girl whom Sihtric loves, you will not belittle her.
 She's an alehouse whore.
 And what is Aethelflaed?
 What is a peace cow if not a whore?
 There's a difference, clearly.
 She will marry and be humped by a man she does not know and for a price.
 Where's the difference?
 It's the way.
 She is a whore in a wedding gown.
 If it is the way, then I belong to your uncle still.
 I will say no more.
 Well, I am pleased to hear it.
 Uhtred.
 Uhtred, as always, it begins as a joy to see you.
 And you, Father Beocca.
 You look well.
 I am well.
 Oh, I would like you to meet Father Pyrlig.
 Lord Uhtred, I've heard much about you.
 Father Pyrlig here was once a warrior himself.
 Sword and spear, Lord, but a man tires of sticking ironware into the bellies of other men.
 I would have enjoyed a cup of ale with you both, but I must leave you.
 You have the letter secure?
 I do, Father.
 I've put it right next to my ball bag.
 Lord Uhtred, it was an honour.
 Unusual priest.
 Yes.
 Uhtred, there is a matter upon which l find myself in need of your advice about Thyra.
 Well, as I say, she's-she's well, she's delightful.
 But my problem is this She must leave, I feel.
 Join you at Coccham or return to Ragnar.
 You don't want her here?
 No.
 Yes, I mean No, I do want her here, it's just that l l simply cannot think.
 I can't work, I can't sleep.
 It has been like this for months.
 I mean, I can barely pray, and even when I do pray, I pray only for myself, which is wrong, very wrong.
 Sinful.
 Wrong.
 I didn't realise she had become such a burden, Father.
 I mean, she's not a burden.
 She could never be a burden.
 Then, Father, I'm lost.
 Why must she leave?
 Because I cannot think of anything but her.
 It is constant and it is pathetic and hopeless because Well, she is fair and I am, Beocca, a man old enough to be her much older brother.
 You're smiling.
 No.
 
 You're laughing at me.
 No, Father, I swear, I'm not laughing at you.
 Well, I can see your teeth.
 I'm sharing your joy.
 There is no joy.
 I feel I am in a purgatory of sorts.
 Thyra will not go to Ragnar.
 She is happy here in Winchester with you.
 Nonsense.
 Beocca, you are her peace.
 Her happiness.
 Marry her.
 Marry her?
 You should marry her, Father.
 And bed her.
 And then give thanks to God for giving us such a joy.
 Praise him, Father.
 Praise Him!
 
 But what if she refuses?
 
 Is that Aethelred?
 Hmm.
 From what I know, Alfred could not have chosen a bigger turd.
 I've never met the man, but by the look of him, he was indeed shat out the arse of a giant.
 He is to be King of Mercia, they are saying.
 The Ealdormen of the Witan, they're saying.
 The Lord of Mercia, perhaps.
 Alfred would never allow another Saxon to be called King.
 Nor would a certain dead man called Bjorn.
 He wishes to meet you.
 Come with me.
 You're pinching my skin!
 You're pinching my skin!
 This was clean!
 Why is it that you are being trusted with my business?
 Who gave you this message?
 A skald.
 A pagan skald.
 His name?!
 Eilaf?
 Eilif?
 Something Dane, something odd!
 Are you any wiser?
 No, you are not.
 I am a messenger, nothing more.
 Like it or not, we are bonded, you and l.
 Bonded?
 Yes!
 Our ancestors were kings and yet we are barely acknowledged as Ealdormen!
 We deserve more.
 You especially deserve more.
 As for me, I have a chamber in the palace and that is it.
 That is the sum of my land.
 He has given me nothing.
 I am no longer part of the Witan, even.
 Uhtred, I can see you are torn, but why should we stand by and watch while power and wealth is given to the likes of Aethelred of Mercia?
 You were witness, you saw him just now, riding through Winchester like a peacock, like he was King!
 When?
 When am I to meet with Bjorn?
 If we leave tonight, we can be back here in two days, in time for the wedding.
 I am to take you there.
 Watch him rise from his grave and you will know that it is all true.
 He will not ask again.
 Lord!
 Don't speak!
 Don't move!
 We leave as soon as my horses are cooled and fed.
 The winds are blowing a change, Lord King.
 
 You'll be glad to hear that I have made my decision.
 You may marry this girl Lord, thank you!
 Upon completion of a task.
 You'll fetch Clapa, you'll go to the stab and wait for me.
 Ensure the horses are watered and fed, but ready.
 Yes, Lord.
 Go.
 And thank you, Lord.
 We will name our first son Uhtred, Lord.
 No, you will not!
 No, I will not.
 Thyra?
 
 Beocca.
 You you gave me a fright.
 Forgive me.
 Are you coming inside?
 I have supper.
 Something I needed to say, Thyra, something I need to to ask.
 You should ask it Marry me!
 II said l said, marry me.
 It was selfish of me to ask, to even mention the word.
 But l fear you have become someone I cannot live without.
 You fear?
 Life without you Fear no more.
 I am here.
 Always.
 Supper?
 Praise Him.
 This is it.
 Skalds' Hall.
 It was given to Eilaf by his lord, for great service.
 Sihtric, you will go no further, not until we are at the hall and inside.
 At all times, you will remain unseen.
 Yes, Lord.
 If the dead man rises, when he returns to his grave, you will keep watching.
 What if he sees me, Lord?
 What if what if he knows that I'm near?
 Then you shit yourself.
 
 You will remain unseen and keep watch.
 Yes, Lord.
 There are men.
 Warriors.
 We are here to see Eilaf, the Skald.
 We have an invitation.
 Who leads here?
 You?
 I do.
 I am Haesten, and you are Uhtred of Bebbanburg.
 You spared me at Eoferwic, Lord.
 You are expected and welcome.
 
 Go take a piss.
 Who is he?
 A thief, Lord.
 I serve Erik, Sigefrid's brother.
 He sends you good wishes.
 Erik is not here?
 He is not, and if I had my way, I would not be here.
 My men are afraid.
 Of ghosts?
 It is not a sight you will forget.
 My Lord wants you to know that by now he will be at Beamfleot and not Frankia.
 With Sigefrid?
 And his brother and with the fleet.
 He insisted you were told.
 And where to after Beamfleot?
 I can't say.
 But it is hoped that you will join us there.
 Eilaf is resting, Lord, in preparation for tonight.
 You may wish to do the same.
 They have a fleet.
 How many, I wonder?
 19 ships.
 That's more than 500 men, plus those already there.
 And those who will come.
 Then, it has started.
 What?
 The end of the peace.
 You stand too close, girl.
 Do not make me speak to you again.
 Once the marriage is made, you should consider making Aethelred earn his privilege.
 Skirmishes and raids from the Danes must not be tolerated, not one.
 It should be made Aethelred's responsibility.
 And the Mercian Ealdormen should be invited to attend a Wessex Witan.
 For the purpose of what?
 For the purpose of bowing to the King and watching the Lord of Mercia do the same.
 I do not doubt for a moment that Aethelred has dreamt, is dreaming, of overtaking me.
 It would be a simple reminder of his position.
 
 Excuse me, Lord.
 Odda.
 Come in, join us.
 Lord, it is about both something and nothing.
 Sit.
 Uhtred has left Winchester, last night.
 And gone where?
 We don't know for certain.
 And what of his current witch?
 His wife, dear.
 The lady Gisela remains in Winchester.
 Well, he can't have gone far.
 Aethelwold is with Uhtred.
 They went in which direction?
 Mercia, Lord.
 I think it is something more than nothing, Odda, and I am wholly tired at never-ending disobedience.
 But it will not ruin your appetite, Lord.
 It will not.
 Put a watch on Gisela.
 She must not leave until her husband has returned and explained his absence.
 Father Beocca.
 Lord.
 Lord, Lady, I have news.
 Uhtred has returned?
 From where, Lord?
 What is your news, Father Beocca?
 I am to be married.
 The once proud and brave Earl Guthrum.
 He now calls himself a Christian!
 
 He now calls himself King Aethelstan, but he's nothing but Alfred's hound, and he's shamed us all!
 
 He has shamed every warrior that has gone before us!
 
 He has shamed the gods!
 
 And the gods call upon every man gathered here today to avenge them!
 
 And avenge them we will!
 By sunrise tomorrow, Lunden and all of its riches shall be yours!
 
 Believe me when I tell you, the gods are with us!
 The gods are with us!
 
 
 
 Forgive me for not being awake to greet you, Lord.
 Bjorn has given me little rest these recent times.
 We understand.
 The gods are wanting true men.
 So, I thank you for being here, Uhtred of Bebbanburg.
 After tonight, I hope to sleep.
 Fetch the blood.
 
 It is time.
 It's a Christian graveyard.
 Yes, Lord.
 Perhaps that is why Bjorn cannot rest Nor pass.
 
 Please, no.
 Please.
 Please!
 To raise the dead, Lord, we need to send a messenger across the gulf.
 He is guilty?
 Twice over.
 Please, I beg you, Lord, please!
 I have a wife, I have children!
 Please!
 What did you steal?
 Just a lamb, Lord, for my family.
 And furs.
 For my family, Lord!
 I'm sorry, but a thief twice over deserves to die.
 No!
 Please, please!
 Put it in his mouth.
 Please, no, please, Lord, I beg you, please!
 I can fight, I can work, I can serve you, Lord!
 Please, I beg of you!
 I am on your side, Lord!
 What is it?
 Please!
 No, Lord, please, no!
 
 Shhh.
 A harp string, Lord.
 A bridge from our world to Bjorn's.
 kill him.
 No, please, Lord!
 Please, Lord, no, please!
 Get the message into his mouth and kill him.
 Spare me!
 Spare me and I will repay you with gratitude!
 Please, Lord!
 Please, Lord!
 
 Bjorn, you have blood.
 I have given you life.
 I have sent you a message.
 If it's peace that you want, you shall not have it until we hear you speak.
 
 The harp string.
 Welcome, Bjorn.
 This is Lord Uhtred, who has sent a good many Dane to the place where you live.
 I do not live.
 You have a message for Lord Uhtred.
 Lord Uhtred.
 I see you now.
 The gods have had their sacrifice and the brothers have tonight begun that which cannot be stopped.
 Lunden's streets are red with Saxon blood.
 You are to be King.
 King of Mercia, King of Saxon and Dane.
 King of other kings.
 You, Lord Uhtred.
 
 Bury him.
 Lord King?
 It is done.
 
 
 What we have just witnessed.
 Do you believe it to be true?
 I do.
 And me.
 It put a shiver through your spine, no doubt.
 So, what now?
 You are sworn to Alfred.
 Alfred is nothing compared to the gods, I would suggest.
 Uhtred, it is our birth-right to be called kings.
 Haesten!
 Lord?
 The brothers Sigefrid and Erik, is it true what Bjorn says?
 They're attacking Lunden?
 I cannot say for certain, Lord, but that was the plan, to sail upriver and take Lunden, which would now be your city, as King of Mercia.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SEASON: 02
EPISODE: 04
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred.
 When I was a child, my sister, Thyra, was attacked by Sven, and he looked at her nakedness.
 Our father exacted his revenge.
 Then I shall only take his one eye.
 Argh!
 Ah!
 Ah!
 Kjartan, you are banished!
 So, years later, Kjartan burned down our home and killed our parents.
 I thought Thyra dead.
 I will not stand by and have everything that's mine taken from me.
 But she lives.
 Held in chains, just as I was held in chains.
 She will not die a slave.
 She will not share Halig's fate.
 Under orders of King Alfred, my brother, Ragnar, found and freed me.
 Seeking revenge for my friend, for my own captivity and Gisela being taken from me, I killed the Abbot Eadred, a man of God.
 My price was to renew my oath of allegiance to Alfred of Wessex.
 Destiny is all.
 Uhtred?
 Mm?
 When you go to Eoferwic will you kill my brother?
 Are you asking if I will, or are you telling me to do it?
 The first one.
 I have sworn to Alfred that Guthred will not be harmed.
 I want to go with you.
 No.
 You might return to find me claimed by another, like vacant land.
 Gisela, no.
 Alfred could marry me off to some ealdorman and you would not be here to stop it!
 
 What is funny?
 It would not be the first time a king has tried.
 You're not coming with me.
 It would be too dangerous for you.
 It is for you, too.
 I could not I could not bear it to have you taken from me again.
 What's this?
 Are you leaving without me?
 Brida has gone already.
 She's gathering my men whatever is left of them.
 You will meet them where?
 Loidis.
 I'd ask you to come with me, but I hear you've been making more of your oaths.
 I will be with you.
 Our plan doesn't change.
 You belong to Alfred.
 Our plan doesn't change.
 Alfred sends me to kill Erik and Sigefrid.
 If I succeed, then Guthred will be in my debt and I will demand the use of his men.
 I have men and we have our own war, we do not need Guthred's.
 How many men?
 Enough to take Dunholm?
 Guthred made you a slave!
 And by swearing to Alfred, you remain a slave!
 Why?
 I have my reasons.
 I would like to hear those reasons.
 I did not forget what Guthred did to me.
 But if it means we have a greater chance of killing Kjartan, if it means we find our sister, then I will do what Alfred asks.
 Kjartan falls by MY sword.
 He will, brother.
 He will.
 Lord?
 You asked for me?
 I did.
 The king should be at the centre surrounded by his enemies.
 I am sending Uhtred to Eoferwic to aid Guthred against the brothers who would take the city for themselves.
 I want you to go with him.
 Stea pa shall accompany you.
 Remain at his side.
 Lord, forgive me, but I do not see what need Uhtred would have of me.
 It is not Uhtred's need that concerns me, it is mine.
 Guthred's misjudgments have divided Northumbria.
 I sent Uhtred to reassert Guthred's authority.
 I am sending you to remind King Guthred of his debt and obligations to Wessex.
 Surely a letter would suit the purpose?
 A letter is constant, whereas I shall merely come and go.
 Think of this as a reward, Aethelwold.
 You have proven yourself, both in battle and within my Witan.
 You have also sought greater responsibilities.
 In Wessex, yes.
 Responsibilities in Mercia, perhaps, but Northumbria?!
 Lord, they are almost Scots.
 Should I turn my hair red?
 You will remind Uhtred of his oaths, but, above all, you will reassure our northern king that in spite of what has passed, my commitment to his prosperity has not waned.
 Eoferwic must remain Christian.
 You do me a great honour.
 You shall be my eyes, ears and voice, Aethelwold.
 Hm.
 A bold response.
 Yes, Father, I thought so.
 Take this.
 It is the symbol of my kingship.
 Bear it with authority.
 Make yourself ready.
 Consider how you spend this time.
 Tomorrow, you're my errands man.
 Father Beocca?
 Uhtred!
 Thank you.
 Come to make your peace with God?
 Come to find you.
 You weren't in your room, nor the brothel.
 Well, l I've been very busy.
 These are for Guthred?
 Yes.
 Fortunes of kings.
 Their failures are rewarded with gifts.
 Father?
 Is something wrong?
 I need you to marry me to Gisela.
 What?!
 I want us to make our pledges before I ride for Eoferwic.
 Mildrith has joined the order, I am free to marry.
 You have Alfred's blessing?
 It's not Alfred I wish to marry!
 Beocca, this cannot wait.
 You love her?
 I do.
 I feel you are too fond of love.
 Nevertheless, bring her here, but quietly.
 We need to be quick and discreet.
 Quick and discreet!
 We're off to the great north, you and l.
 I'm to be Alfred's errand boy.
 He wants me away from Winchester Aethelwold, I'm not listening.
 He wants me dead, even!
 Now that is the plan, I know it!
 One may be overpowered.
 Two can defend themselves.
 A cord of three is not so quickly broken Now that you are bound together, Uhtred and Gisela I can declare you man and wife.
 Now I will never be taken from you.
 Ragnar rides with them, Lord?
 A Dane?
 You have doubts, Odda?
 Then we shall air them.
 Lord, should he survive, I fear Uhtred will not return.
 You believe he will break his oath?
 I believe Bebbanburg will hold a greater pull than Wessex.
 Should he rid Northumbria of these Northmen, he will look towards Kjartan, his blood feud.
 Yes, but that is no bad thing.
 But, Lord, should he defeat Kjartan, then who holds the power in Northumbria?
 Uhtred and Ragnar?
 Pagans.
 Well, there is that risk, but firstly, Uhtred is a warrior.
 A Viking, even.
 He will forever be restless.
 Perhaps.
 And secondly, should he turn his attention to Bebbanburg, and, indeed, to Northumbria as a whole, then Steapa is under instruction to kill him.
 When will we have sight of Eoferwic?
 I have never ridden for so long nor so far.
 Have you a sore arse, lord?
 I have a sore everything.
 I need a woman to rub and bathe me.
 
 We will be stopping soon enough.
 At Eoferwic?
 We ride first for Loidis.
 What awaits us at Loidis?
 We shall see.
 Need I remind you, first and foremost, our purpose here is the king's business.
 Nothing has changed but our path, Beocca.
 We shall see.
 Brida!
 You brought friends?
 They serve Alfred.
 Do we have men?
 Some.
 Hm?
 This way.
 Well, that was a warm greeting.
 Uhtred.
 Uhtred, you were sent north to aid Guthred, not to go chasing revenge.
 Perhaps I plan to do both, Father.
 Well, I think I know what you plan.
 Uhtred, revenge will not bring you peace, only death.
 Father Beocca, you will have me kill for Alfred but not for myself.
 Why is that?
 And what business does Alfred have with Northumbria?
 God's business!
 
 
 
 I didn't think so many would come.
 Ragnar?
 Rollo.
 What makes you think we're here for you?
 
 Guthred is seen as weak and friendless.
 These men won't fight the brothers for a turd.
 We need the turd's army to take Dunholm.
 So, why not kill the Northmen, then kill the turd, take Eoferwic and its army for yourself?
 The woman's got a point.
 No, she does not have a point.
 Those are the words of a traitor!
 I don't want Eoferwic.
 All I want is Kjartan's heart on the end of my sword, and to see my sister.
 We will need Guthred's army.
 I promised these men silver and the glory of avenging your father.
 Don't dishonour them by getting them killed for Guthred, the turd.
 Oh, Ragnar, your woman's got the balls of a bear.
 I like her.
 She's right.
 What do you mean, she's right?
 Beocca, she's right!
 These men are here for Ragnar, we can't ask them to die for the like of Guthred.
 Isn't it what Danes do, fight?
 We cannot face the brothers alone.
 Why not?
 Finan, there is bravery and then there is stupidity.
 The Northmen have a camp, do they not?
 Not a fortress, but an open camp.
 If it is Sigefrid and Erik we must kill, then let us just do that.
 We kill them while they're sleeping.
 Shadow-walkers.
 Open the gates!
 They are here in Northumbria.
 Uhtred and Ragnar.
 How many men?
 They had barely 50 at Loidis.
 They'll find others.
 They'll go to their poxy King Guthred.
 I want every man aware and ready.
 No drunkenness till it's done, no matter how long.
 Do you believe they will attack?
 Place rocks, wood and fire on the ramparts.
 We should hunt them down now, before they can turn their 50 men into 500 men.
 50 men can win a battle in the open, but no army of any size can breach this fortress.
 If Uhtred and Ragnar's wish is to kill me they can die trying at my gates.
 Was I not heard?
 Go!
 Father, what can I do?
 Go to your wild whore.
 Tell her she need not feed her hounds.
 
 Thyra?
 I told you to stay out.
 Your brother Ragnar is here in Northumbria.
 He will attack.
 My father demands that you let the hounds go hungry.
 But if you don't if you do not want that, I can tell Father that I have no brother.
 
 I have no brother!
 Get out!
 GET OUT!
 
 
 
 I see three on watch.
 The rest will be huddled inside their furs.
 There could be more behind the tents, sitting low.
 I don't have a good feeling about this.
 Which tents are full and which are empty?
 And in which tent is Sigefrid and which is Erik?
 We are blind.
 Tafl.
 The game, tafl.
 The king is positioned at the centre of the pieces.
 I would say that tent there is the king.
 From any other mouth, it'd make perfect sense.
 It is perfect sense.
 I will go in alone.
 I think you should.
 No, we go in as agreed, together.
 We cannot risk the both of us being killed.
 Yes, we can.
 This is for Alfred, you must save your sword for Kjartan.
 If it is for Alfred I will go with you.
 And me!
 It was my bastard plan.
 And I shall wish you all the best of luck.
 If you get caught?
 Do nothing.
 Ragnar, think only of our blood feud and of Thyra.
 I hope you're light on your feet, big man.
 
 
 
 Argh!
 You want to kill me, Uhtred Ragnarson?
 That was the plan.
 You don't like me?
 I can be a funny man.
 
 
 
 
 Raiders!
 Raiders!
 Raiders!
 Necessary.
 Stand clear, let them see me!
 Let them all see me!
 They'll be slaughtered where they stand!
 And you with them.
 You save your sword for Kjartan!
 Erik, I swear, I'll kill him and be damned what follows!
 No-one is to move!
 No-one!
 Stand still!
 kill him!
 kill him!
 kill him!
 No-one is to as much as raise their sword!
 Uhtred, you will spare him!
 Steady your men!
 Back!
 Hold!
 Uhtred, you will spare my brother!
 Name your price!
 kill him, Erik!
 kill him, I say!
 Erik!
 Haesten!
 Sigefrid, there will be another day, another time!
 kill HIM!
 Uhtred!
 Name your price.
 It will be done, I swear!
 I give you my word.
 kill him and you kill yourself.
 Your word?!
 I swear!
 Believe me!
 You will take one ship and you will leave Northumbria.
 One ship!
 You will not return!
 For my brother's life, this is done!
 
 I swear that I will kill you, Uhtred Ragnarson!
 This is not finished!
 I see you ARE a funny man.
 
 We are here at the request of Alfred of Wessex!
 The king will wish to see us!
 Open the doors!
 Uhtred, I will speak first.
 Father, you will say nothing!
 Uhtred?
 Father Beocca, I I had heard that you were close.
 I, er I'd not realised how close.
 Lord, King Alfred has sent us here to Father Beocca!
 You will allow King Guthred to speak first.
 I had also heard that you had been recovered, Uhtred.
 I am glad.
 Believe me.
 Well, if you're here to kill me, I don't blame you.
 I would kill me, too.
 Huh!
 But it would be a mistake.
 Another mistake.
 Lord Guthred?
 I am Lord Aethelwold, I come in King Alfred's stead.
 We have gifts.
 Sigefrid's sword hand.
 The brothers won't trouble you again.
 They are dead?
 In return, you will give me your army.
 You will ready them to march.
 But You will do as I ask, Guthred, or I shall kill you.
 He does not know what he says, Lord.
 No!
 Steapa, no!
 I will kill you and take every consequence.
 What you did to me what you did to Halig I could never forget.
 I shall never forgive.
 You will ready your men to march.
 How do I know that the brothers are gone?!
 How do I know that this hand belongs to Sigefrid?!
 Like your uncle, I would have preferred a head.
 Two heads!
 Another word, Lord, and it will be your own head.
 You will do as my brother asks, or I will take Eoferwic and the army for myself.
 Beocca!
 The king has a decision to make.
 He's either with us or against us.
 
 You're lucky.
 Nothing's broken.
 It'll hurt wielding your sword, though.
 Well, we cannot wait for the wounded.
 You will not have to wait for the wounded.
 We should kill him.
 Guthred, the turd king.
 Do you never tire of menace?
 I do not.
 If we are successful in taking Dunholm, who gets to keep it?
 Guthred.
 Guthred, naturally.
 He has Eoferwic.
 Ragnar should have it.
 No.
 It is Alfred's wish that it goes to Guthred.
 Alfred has never set one foot in Northumbria, it's not his decision to make.
 Kjartan built Dunholm on the blood of Ragnar the Fearless.
 Belongs to his blood son, Ragnar.
 As long as my sword finds Kjartan's heart, I do not care.
 I care.
 The arseling is right, for once.
 He is wrong.
 Uhtred, you say Alfred has never set foot in Northumbria.
 He has no need.
 We are here, all of us, to do his bidding.
 And he knows how each of us will think, what each of us will do.
 Eoferwic can never be the seat of power in Northumbria whilst Dunholm remains strong, and so he allows Uhtred to attack.
 He allows nothing.
 I'm here because it's my business to be here.
 Uhtred, you are his man.
 You, more than anyone, will bring about his dream of an England.
 Alfred's wish is for Guthred to become the one true lord of the north, and you will make that happen.
 I say it as I now see it.
 You have shit in your eye.
 I see it as a king would see it.
 He was crying like a baby, so I just
 
 Oh, his eyes were popping out of his head, I swear to God!
 Uhtred?
 Uhtred, will you join me, please?
 Please?
 I am a little afraid of you, Uhtred of Bebbanburg.
 Envious.
 I am king because the abbot claimed to have seen my face in a dream.
 But it was your face that he assumed to be king, I I feared that you would take my newly-found power.
 I gave you my word.
 You did.
 But you made me a slave.
 Yes.
 Hm!
 Yes.
 But in my defence, I was meant to kill you.
 I spared your life.
 Uhtred!
 No!
 
 You were my friend and I betrayed you.
 My sister is well?
 She's my wife.
 Good.
 Good.
 
 I shall write to Alfred, I shall inform him that that your journey to Dunholm is my instruction.
 
 And I do hope that you can one day find a place in your heart to forgive me.
 I still consider you my greatest friend.
 What did he say?
 He said Dunholm is yours, brother.
 Sihtric?
 Lord?
 You lied to me.
 Lord, I would never You told me Dunholm has no weaknesses.
 Yet last time I was there, I saw a door along the east wall.
 Access to a water spring.
 Yes, Lord, but you could never bring an army through it.
 I would not be bringing an army.
 This is madness.
 The rightful King of Wessex helping to avenge the death of a big hairy Viking.
 It would make a good song.
 Well, should you die, Aethelwold, I shall have it written.
 Halt!
 Halt!
 Ssh!
 This is where we part.
 We will show ourselves only when we know the east door has been opened.
 We will attack then it's up to you to save us.
 We will be theirs to slaughter.
 Lord, may the gods be with you.
 God.
 May God be with him.
 Us.
 You just watch over Ragnar, hm?
 Good luck, little brother.
 See you all in Dunholm.
 Move quickly.
 We must be in place before dawn.
 This path is fit for goats only.
 You be quiet and watch where you're placing your feet!
 Bless you.
 That ram we have dragged, it will not work.
 It will not force open the gates but it will work in its own way.
 We rest, we wait.
 
 I know!
 
 This will be the day.
 Kjartan or Valhalla.
 The day of days.
 
 Ragnar?
 Their signal.
 It begins.
 Now?
 Shield wall!
 Warriors at the north gate!
 Warriors at the north gate!
 To the end.
 
 
 
 Every man to the ramparts!
 Back!
 Keep together!
 Stop!
 
 Forward!
 Stay close!
 Go, go, go now!
 More spears!
 Now!
 Back!
 Back!
 
 Use the fire!
 Burn the bastards!
 Tip it!
 
 When we attack, Steapa 
 I know, Lord, to the gate.
 
 
 Help!
 Help!
 
 Courage!
 We stand!
 Every man is to stand!
 
 Lord!
 Breach!
 With me now!
 Steapa!
 The gate!
 kill them!
 To the gate!
 We must get to the gate!
 Stop them!
 kill them!
 It is to the end!
 Next group, go!
 Glory or Valhalla!
 Go!
 
 Protect the gate!
 Hold fast!
 Hold fast, Ragnar!
 
 Pull back!
 Pull back!
 Pull back!
 
 Kjartan!
 Where are you?!
 Shield wall!
 
 Pull back!
 Come on!
 
 
 Thyra?
 Thyra?
 Thyra!
 No Please!
 Please!
 Thyra?
 kill!
 Thyra!
 
 SVEN!
 Kjartan you are beaten.
 Either you die alone, or together with all your men.
 What is it to be?
 You wish to fight me, baby Ragnar?
 No, l wish to kill you.
 Drop your weapon.
 It's over.
 Shield!
 Ragnar, no!
 No, no!
 No, Ragnar, don't give him the chance.
 Burn the bastard, Ragnar!
 Brida!
 You and me.
 Move!
 We make the square!
 Your sister made a good whore!
 
 
 She still does!
 Only now we have to tie her down to keep her from scratching when we hump her all night.
 Come on, Ragnar!
 Ragnar!
 I killed your father!
 Get up, Ragnar!
 Now get up!
 I burned your mother!
 Go, Ragnar!
 No!
 No, give me my sword!
 For Valhalla, you must give me my sword!
 I won't beg you.
 Die.
 Give me my sword!
 
 
 Yes!
 Stop.
 
 
 Ragnar?
 Ragnar!
 It's over.
 It's over.
 Shh, shh.
 It's Thyra.
 
 You left me.
 Both of you, you left me!
 Thyra, no.
 I swear, we didn't know you were alive.
 You are no better than the bastards who whored me.
 Thyra, please.
 The price for my life is yours.
 No!
 Thyra I forbid it.
 Please Please.
 Let me help you.
 I'm a friend.
 
 I have not seen you fight like that before.
 That wasn't fighting.
 That was Well, killing him was not enough.
 It can never be enough.
 But it's done.
 We've honoured them.
 Yes.
 So, er what now?
 Bebbanburg?
 
 Wessex.
 It must be Wessex, or Steapa will have instruction to kill me, I'm sure.
 I need peace for a time.
 I need my woman.
 And what of Thyra?
 Whatever else, she's safe.
 
 I will not hurt you.
 I promise.
 You do not know me but I have known your brother Uhtred since he was a small boy.
 I am Beocca.
 This place is Ragnar's now.
 You have no need to hide.
 He and Uhtred have wanted for so long to find you.
 You have shown incredible strength, Thyra.
 I would say God-given.
 Bless you.
 Stay.
 Uhtred, he saved me once before, from Sven, when he was your little boy.
 Yes.
 He would do that.

SEASON: 02
EPISODE: 03
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred.
 I released the slave Guthred and saw him crowned King of Cumbraland.
 I fell in love with his sister while commanding his troops.
 I wish to be seen as Sigefrid's equal.
 I ask that you offer your sister in marriage.
 He behaves as if HE were king!
 To defeat Kjartan the Cruel, an alliance was formed with the brothers Erik and Sigefrid.
 Kjartan's land will become your land.
 To peace.
 But Guthred's counsellors saw me as a threat and wanted Christian men in the army.
 He believes himself to be above each one of us.
 And so a secret bargain was made with my uncle.
 200 spears.
 In return I shall require the head of Osbert.
 What are you doing?
 Guthred showed clemency, but still betrayed me.
 You will become a slave, Uhtred, and Halig with you.
 King Alfred freed my brother Ragnar to rescue me.
 But he was too late.
 Argh!
 You belong to me now.
 Destiny is all.
 Pull, you bastards!
 Hyah!
 Pull, we need to fly!
 Pull!
 
 It's like looking out of a grave.
 That will not be our fate I swear to you.
 You think these bastards will bother digging a hole for you?
 We are destined to be tossed overboard with the rest of the shite.
 I'll tell you, Finan, it would be my own bad luck if I got tossed overboard alive.
 I can't swim.
 Never give up, Halig.
 Shut your mouth back there!
 Never give in.
 You don't speak, slave.
 You pull!
 Yes, men!
 We pull!
 Pull!
 Pull!
 Pull!
 Pull!
 Pull!
 Pull!
 One day, Osbert, I will kill that bastard and savour it.
 200 spears as promised.
 A man of his word.
 It would seem.
 We can lay a siege to Dunholm as early as tomorrow.
 The unified armies of Guthred, Aelfric, the two brothers, we march on Dunholm.
 We show Kjartan our numbers.
 We stand fast.
 We starve Kjartan of water, food life itself.
 How did he die?
 Who?
 Uhtred, Lord.
 His name is Osbert.
 Did he shit his britches?
 Did he beg for mercy?
 I want to know.
 Uhtred would never beg.
 Your queen?
 No.
 She has a free tongue, Lord Aelfric.
 She will say nothing more.
 Well, l wish to see it.
 My nephew's head.
 Where is it?
 Where it has always been.
 On his shoulders.
 Rest assured that Uhtred is as good as dead.
 As good as dead?
 Then he is still alive?
 For the siege of Dunholm, we agreed 200 spears, for his head.
 That was the bargain.
 Lord, he is a ship's slave.
 In reality, Osbert's been given a fate far, far worse than death.
 You must understand Uhtred saved my life.
 He was my friend.
 Your friend?
 Yes.
 Lord, I swear, you shall never hear from him again.
 Perhaps I should make an ally of Kjartan, once again.
 Maybe he will succeed where you have so wilfully failed.
 All I required was a single, lifeless head.
 Lord, may I suggest that you rest?
 Aidan, how many days have we been marching?
 Six days, Lord.
 And you should rest.
 Six days for no reward!
 Lord, rest.
 Eat.
 Drink.
 There must be something we can do or offer to make this right.
 Lord Aelfric, you will have gathered by now that my brother is part fool.
 You should have nothing more to do with him.
 My sister has humour and a tongue!
 We leave tomorrow.
 Lord, I beg you My business here is over.
 Goodbye, Lord Aelfric, so nice to meet you.
 Enjoy the long walk home to Bebbanburg.
 Guthred, by saving Uhtred, what you now have is a chaos of your own making.
 Chaos.
 If Aelfric is not with us then the ground has shifted.
 We'll take no part in the siege of Dunholm.
 Erik, we must!
 We have an agreement, we have plans.
 That will no longer involve the brothers.
 No Dunholm means we must again fight for our wealth.
 Sigefrid, we do have a peace.
 We DO have a peace!
 Lord, we are in need of an ally.
 You must offer your sister.
 The horses are ready?
 They are, Lady.
 Sihtric, I choose you because you are loyal to Lord Uhtred.
 Always, Lady.
 You will give this note to Hild when she returns.
 She will return.
 How long will you be gone, Lady?
 All I know is that I cannot stay.
 We are Wessex, of course, and to our north lies Mercia, our allies.
 Mm-hmm, and to the east?
 Danelaw.
 Above is Northumbria and Cumbraland, where pagans rule and threat our Christian brothers.
 And beyond the Great Wall is the kingdom that they call Alba, where it is cold and wild.
 Good.
 And what do we call everything south of the wall?
 That will one day be England.
 Aethelflaed, it would cost a great deal of both blood and silver to conquer these lands, even more to hold the ground.
 And so alliances must be forged.
 Unions made.
 I am to be married?
 Once a suitable match has been made.
 I am ready to do my duty.
 
 There is a beauty to a burning village.
 It's like you said Chaos.
 
 
 I wish to be known as Sigefrid Lord of Chaos.
 Quickly, come on.
 Sister Hild and company, what is your purpose?
 We're here on the orders of Alfred of Wessex.
 I want to see King Guthred.
 You are a Dane.
 I am Earl Ragnar Ragnarson.
 This is the warrior Steapa, Alfred's man.
 Alfred sends greeting to King Guthred.
 And Guthred's sister, Lady Gisela.
 Is she here?
 I would like to see her.
 She is not.
 She did abandon the city.
 Where to?
 I have yet to find out, but I shall find out.
 You are his brother?
 You're Uhtred's brother.
 It is Guthred.
 I am, Lord.
 Alfred sent you to do what?
 To find Uhtred.
 He is in Uhtred's debt and will not see him harmed.
 Uhtred is lost.
 I'm truly sorry to say that.
 My apologies to both you and to Alfred.
 There, you've had a wasted journey.
 Rest, please, here, by all means You will tell me the name of the man who took Uhtred.
 Ll need to gather my thoughts.
 Lord, I wish to know the name of the slaver.
 If you are truly sorry, you will tell me and where to find him.
 Uhtred is indeed lost.
 Bail, you dogs!
 Release our chains!
 We'll work faster.
 Bail out or you'll go down with her!
 You want to live?
 You bail!
 I pray God will keep him safe, Lady.
 
 Osbert, he will not stop bailing.
 Rest.
 You will need your strength.
 I am happy enough to bail.
 Hey!
 
 Oh.
 Oh, you think you're better than these men?
 They are property.
 As are you.
 You should let go of your pride.
 It will be the death of you.
 Rest.
 He's right, you should rest.
 We're wasting away, you and l.
 We should be saving what's left of our strength to run.
 But to run we'll need skin on our feet and not rotting flesh.
 Then we should bail.
 These wretches all tell the same story, Lord.
 They flee slaughter at the hands of the brothers.
 We must surely be next.
 And what do I do?
 Do I fight?
 Do I now march against the brothers?
 It is not my place to instruct a king in the ways of war.
 I am asking for your counsel!
 I am without a commander of my guard.
 Then I would say we need first to secure grain enough for the winter to feed these wretches.
 And I would say we need Lord Aelfric of Bebbanburg, now more than ever.
 We would appreciate some water, for ourselves and the horses.
 It's yours.
 You are Jonis?
 I am.
 I've been told that you took a man, a warrior, from Guthred of Eoferwic.
 You sold him as a slave.
 I see the faces of so many creatures.
 I'm not here to open your belly, Jonis.
 Not yet.
 I'll pay you.
 Here.
 You will not feed the slaves!
 And you will not bark like a great, fat hound!
 You said you will pay?
 Yes, I did.
 A warrior slave, called himself Osbert.
 There was another man.
 Smaller, Saxon.
 A sea trader named Sverri took them both.
 Where is Sverri now?
 Wherever the sea and promise of silver takes him.
 Life at the oar is hard and short.
 Sverri will return, I'm sure, refresh his crew.
 When?
 Autumn and winter will pass.
 But, come spring, the first full moon after Sigrblot, we will gather for business at the beach.
 Sverri will be there, I swear.
 And between that time he sails where?
 His ships plough the roughest sea.
 He could be any place.
 You tell us nothing.
 I tell you what I know to be true.
 All you can do is watch the beaches and wait.
 Move it.
 It's East Anglia.
 It could well be Frankia.
 Drink water.
 I need land.
 Yes.
 Lord, I need land.
 I need to get out.
 I need land!
 Halig!
 I need land!
 Back at your place!
 He is back in his place.
 Tell them who you are, tell them you have silver!
 You will be quiet now!
 He is sick with the fever!
 We will hold him!
 I said we will hold him!
 Worthless slaves.
 Halig.
 Halig.
 I can't stay on this ship!
 Halig.
 You are a warrior.
 You followed me into battle at Ethandun.
 You fought bravely.
 Halig!
 You saved me from Kjartan's spies in Cumbraland.
 Remember that?
 I did.
 You did.
 We are warriors!
 And our time will come.
 Look at me, Halig.
 You have followed every order I've ever given you.
 Now I'm giving you one more.
 You will row.
 You will pull and you will wait and our time will come.
 And then together, we shall win.
 Together.
 Please tell me he's not here as a suitor.
 He's Ceolwulf, the father of Mercia.
 He is barely alive.
 Lord Ceolwulf.
 Wessex is honoured to welcome you.
 We welcome all of the ealdormen of Mercia.
 We do not.
 May our discussions prove to be beneficial and fruitful for both parties.
 Swords, Alfred.
 I shall make my point clear from the outset.
 We demand swords and the men to carry them.
 To help stem the wave upon wave of raiders, Lord, from the Daneland.
 Forgive my interruption.
 Mercia lost many a warrior at Ethandun, and willingly.
 I expect repayment.
 I hear you, Ceolwulf.
 I consider our lands to be one No, we are not one.
 We are Mercia and you are Wessex.
 Refreshment?
 Swords!
 I will not be silenced.
 Lord Ceolwulf, perhaps a seat?
 It has been a long journey.
 It has.
 For a purpose.
 I understand completely that at times the east of Mercia is overrun with Viking raiders.
 We suffer the same fate along our northern border.
 What of your warrior Uhtred?
 He is a leader of men.
 Dispatch him to our border with Daneland.
 Uhtred and 50 men, I will accept.
 Uhtred was last seen in Northumbria, Lord, the place of his birth.
 Northumbria?
 You can send men to the far north but not to your neighbour?
 Lord Ceolwulf.
 The solution to our problem, I feel, is a bond.
 The solution is swords and men.
 A permanent bond between Wessex and Mercia.
 A union, Lord.
 Swords!
 How many times do I need to say it?!
 How many times am I to be ignored?!
 Lord Ceolwulf, you have read my letters?
 Lord Ceolwulf?
 Yes, of course I have read your letters.
 You're looking for a buck!
 A match, Lord.
 And I have a name for you right here in a letter of my own.
 A good man, godly man.
 Mercian stock, like the lady Aelswith.
 But what guarantee do I have that Mercia will not become a mere appendage of Wessex?
 A poor cousin?
 We are a kingdom.
 Lord, your first concern should be that you do not become an appendage to Daneland.
 And who was it agreed to this thing called Daneland?!
 It was you.
 It was Alfred, and now it is Mercia that suffers most.
 Swords you demand, Lord.
 I do.
 And swords you shall have.
 How many?
 Wessex could never turn away from Mercia.
 It would be akin to Alfred turning away from Aelswith.
 It could never occur, Lord Ceolwulf.
 Never.
 What is this?
 Each time I talk of swords and spears and yet you insist on speaking of unions and of ki A cup of water for Lord Ceolwulf.
 A cup of water?
 
 I think perhaps a hole in the ground.
 He has passed, Lord.
 
 Our, erm Our deepest sympathies are with all of you.
 Be assured that I and the priests of Wessex shall pray for Lord Ceolwulf's soul.
 I pray eternal light will shine upon him.
 We shall adjourn.
 Which one of you is Aethelred?
 I am Aethelred, Lady.
 Aethelred, if you could ensure that Ceolwulf is returned to his family, I would be grateful.
 Yes, Lord.
 Of course, Lord.
 
 Master Sverri and your friend Hakka have good news.
 We're finished now until the spring.
 Winter will be on land.
 Iceland.
 Where there's work to be done.
 Be ready.
 
 Hear that, Halig?
 Land.
 I love land.
 So in place of the head of Osbert, you offer me a bride by your own admission you have misplaced.
 But we will find her, Lord, and soon.
 You will find her when?
 Before I finish my food?
 Before the end of winter?
 Lord, we have eyes across Northumbria and Cumbraland, and we have prayer.
 She will have gone to Cumbraland.
 I I know my sister.
 Ah, but I do not.
 And I know she must be very fond of me, to hide herself away like this.
 Lord, she would not be the first reluctant bride.
 True.
 It is also a truth that she was very fond of your nephew.
 I have a duty to tell you, there was talk of marriage.
 She remains fond of Osbert?
 Oh, I would imagine that he is the reason she is in hiding.
 Then I shall have her.
 You will?
 There are, however, conditions.
 Not one spear shall belong to Eoferwic until Gisela is delivered and is my wife.
 Aidan shall return with you.
 You will treat him well, you will feed him well.
 For the entire winter, should that be necessary.
 I do not eat too much.
 Finally, you will deliver a message, from me to Kjartan.
 Kjartan?
 Saying what?
 Saying how my nephew may be found and therefore killed.
 Why bark when there are hounds available?
 Are we agreed?
 Yes.
 We are agreed.
 I think we might be getting fed, Lord.
 Call him Osbert.
 
 More than you deserve.
 Be grateful.
 
 
 Lord, your gift of warriors.
 They have served Mercia well this past winter.
 The raids are not so frequent now.
 It gladdens me to hear it.
 You have done well, Aethelred.
 Thank you, Lord.
 Now, I believe there is other business.
 Odda?
 Yes, Lord.
 The bride price.
 Well, we I have considered what would be appropriate.
 I propose to gift the Lady Aethelflaed 3,000 pieces.
 4,000 would, perhaps, be more fitting.
 Lord Aethelred, she is the King's daughter, she is not without means.
 Silver, though valuable, does not represent what she will become a Lady of Mercia.
 Perhaps you have a gift with more permanency.
 Ancestry.
 We would, of course, bequeath Aethelflaed titled lands.
 Rich lands, in Mercia to further the union.
 A fair price, I feel.
 Excellent.
 Excellent, Lord.
 To permanency.
 Quick, hide yourself.
 How may I serve you, Sven Kjartensson?
 You will not waste my time.
 We will not speak of silver.
 We will talk of a man you know as Osbert.
 Halig.
 Do not move.
 I said do not move.
 Bastards!
 
 
 Don't just stand there looking idle.
 He has the weight of an ox!
 
 We must divide, go separate ways.
 Halig.
 Keep going.
 
 Come on.
 There!
 A boat!
 Blessed Jesus, there's a bastard boat!
 Halig.
 
 
 Halig.
 Leave me!
 Get him in the boat!
 I'm not leaving you.
 Pull!
 Pull!
 Pull!
 Pull!
 Pull, Lord.
 You are alive only because I am curious to know who you are, and if you'll fetch a good price.
 Pull.
 
 Pull and save him the pain!
 Pull!
 Ugh!
 Pull and give him the peace of death!
 Pull!
 Pull!
 Pull!
 Pull!
 Pull!
 Jonis!
 I'm looking for Jonis, the slaver, is he here?
 Who has seen him?
 You will deal with me today.
 You know who I am?
 I do, Lord.
 You have something that I want, Master Sverri.
 Yes, Lord.
 Uhtred Ragnarson.
 Is that you?
 Is it?
 What do you call this man?
 He calls himself Osbert, but I heard another slave call him "Lord".
 It is him.
 I have waited for this moment.
 Give him a sword.
 A sword!
 
 Sven.
 Yes.
 It is me, Sven the One-Eye.
 Pick it up.
 Pick it up!
 He is too weak.
 [Uhtred] I will kill you.
 Uhtred, I am pleased that you will try.
 He's too weak.
 
 I will be forever the man who killed the great warrior, Uhtred.
 Uhtred.
 Uhtred.
 It's me, it's Ragnar.
 [Uhtred] Ragnar.
 
 Did you believe we would abandon you?
 Free them all.
 
 Pull.
 Halig?
 He has been taken down, wrapped and buried with shield and sword.
 You will say words for him, Hild.
 I have.
 I will, always.
 Northumbria is torn.
 Aelfric did not come to Guthred's side.
 Erik and Sigefrid and Kjartan, they do what they please.
 You haven't asked how I come to be here.
 Alfred.
 Alfred sent us.
 I believe the King of Wessex cares for you.
 You're Uhtred's brother?
 I am.
 You look nothing like each other.
 
 Uhtred, you should eat.
 Finan.
 Oh, we will eat, Lady, but our tummies are small and our feet have barely touched dry land.
 It'll take a little time to find them.
 Are you his brother?
 We are We are bound, I would say.
 Up.
 You've been asleep for a day or more.
 I can do it.
 
 Take off your clothes.
 You have not looked me in the eye, not once.
 I am ashamed of what I became.
 You are Uhtred, son of Uhtred.
 Lord of Bebbanburg.
 It's time you remembered that.
 You kept the blade sharp.
 I knew you'd return.
 She is heavier than I remember.
 How did Alfred come to know of my fate?
 You?
 I will not forget.
 You will always have my protection.
 I could not ask for more.
 And this This is my gift to you.
 Protection.
 You are too good a woman for God alone.
 Uhtred, it IS you.
 The apples are beginning to fall without Shh picking.
 Here we are, Brothers, God's gift.
 Thank you, Mother, most generous.
 You have been to Cumbraland, you say?
 We have, and without luck.
 And you've had no strangers calling to your door, Mother?
 Strangers, yes, traders and wretches, but no ladies.
 Hmm.
 You have an appetite, Lord.
 Mmm.
 I do.
 It's good.
 I'm pleased.
 Alfred waits for your return.
 We have business here, Steapa.
 In the north.
 I gave my word we go to Wessex.
 But we're here, now.
 I gave my word.
 We go directly to Wessex.
 Kjartan can wait, and Thyra must wait.
 And Gisela?
 What of her?
 She's safe.
 She waits for you at the nunnery at Ebchester.
 No.
 Seize her!
 No.
 No!
 No, I will not!
 No!
 Hold her!
 Hold her fast.
 Stand beside her and we shall have her married.
 You have no right!
 I have every right, and you will be quiet.
 Aelfric's man, stand beside her.
 We shall have her married to Aelfric right now.
 Without a husband, Lord?
 I will not marry against my will!
 You cannot Do not strike the poor girl!
 Do as you're told and as God commands!
 Beside her, as proxy.
 You'll stand in for Lord Aelfric.
 We shall dispense with the joining of hands.
 You may take her arm.
 I will not be party to this.
 I will not marry And we shall dispense with the vows.
 
 I hereby proclaim Lady Gisela of Cumbraland and Lord Aelfric of Bebbanburg to be man and wife.
 Gisela!
 Uhtred?
 Uhtred, I'm here!
 Uhtred.
 You will let her go.
 You are too late.
 You will let her go.
 She is married now.
 She belongs to Aelfric.
 It is a lie, Uhtred.
 Where is Aelfric?
 If he is not here, then he cannot be married.
 By proxy, you fool.
 This man stood beside her in place of Aelfric.
 Uhtred, in the eyes of God, she is married.
 Did you hump her for Aelfric?
 He did not.
 Then there's no marriage, it's a lie.
 She is married and it cannot be undone.
 Make her a widow.
 No!
 Gisela is married to Aelfric.
 Not to Aidan.
 I have a wife already.
 A different wife.
 Uhtred, I'm bored with this.
 kill them all.
 Do as you wish.
 In sight of God, she's married.
 Say "she's married" again.
 She's married.
 She's what?
 She is married.
 Uhtred!
 Is she married?
 Yes!
 He is a man of God!
 Say it one more time, priest, and I swear the devil will take you.
 You're nothing but a heathen and the bitch is married!
 You!
 You will go to my uncle and when he asks of his wife, you will tell him she's in the bed of Uhtred of Bebbanburg.
 I trust you are in health.
 I improve with each passing day.
 And you, Lord?
 God afflicts me.
 But there is purpose in that, so I must be glad of it.
 Earl Ragnar, he is a good man.
 I should like to free both him and Brida.
 Thank you, Lord for all you have done.
 What do you think of my candles?
 I find them to be more effective at night.
 I have missed your childish insolence.
 I'm trying to measure the passing of time.
 I'm hoping to find a candle that burns from midday to midday.
 Lord, why did you have me rescued?
 Why have you brought me here?
 I had you rescued firstly because I was able, and secondly, because it is no more than you deserved.
 Though I admit, I would like you in my service once again.
 I am grateful, of course but I have my own path to follow.
 Destiny.
 Destiny, Lord.
 You killed the Abbot Eadred.
 According to the words of Brother Trew and others.
 He was a weasel, Lord.
 A weasel without a sword, a holy weasel.
 Who deserved to die.
 You killed him on blessed ground.
 He was an abbot.
 However, you were in the company of Earl Ragnar, in the charge of Earl Ragnar, who was under my orders and whom I hold responsible for the killing of Abbot Eadred.
 No.
 No, Lord, it was me and me alone.
 Why did he not stop you?
 Lord, you cannot blame Ragnar for the Abbot's death.
 Yes, I can, and I do 
 That is unfair.
 He will stand trial.
 No.
 You are a great warrior, Uhtred.
 You are a Saxon who is also a Dane, the very embodiment of the England that must emerge.
 I request that you enter my service.
 Lord.
 I have been a slave.
 I wish to remain a free man.
 What is it that you wish for Earl Ragnar?
 Lord, please.
 A man of God was slaughtered.
 That cannot be ignored, Someone must answer.
 It will be you or it will be Earl Ragnar.
 You may choose.
 Your sword, Uhtred.
 You can be a free man, within my service.
 Ragnar goes free?
 He has earned it.
 Swear.
 I, Uhtred of Bebban It is the custom to kneel.
 I, Uhtred of Bebbanburg, pledge my sword to you, Alfred of Wessex.

SEASON: 02
EPISODE: 02
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I am, Uhtred, son of Uhtred, I travelled north to Cumberland, where a holy man dreamed of a slave who would be king.
 Is it you?
 I am Guthred.
 I visited the Danes in the guise of a dead horseman, and ensured Guthred's release.
 Over the remains of a blessed saint, he was crowned king.
 Build an army and I will command it.
 Sleep well.
 Sleep well.
 Good night.
 Your sister is pretty.
 The cocksure, long-haired fool there, he's a pretender, I'm sure.
 In Eoferwic, the Saxon people rose up against their invade, the brothers Erik and Sigefrid.
 I know the brothers will seek revenge for what they lost, and that Kjartan the Cruel will not rest in his search for the dead horseman.
 Uhtred Ragnarson is mine.
 Destiny is all.
 I see the new king is keeping you busy.
 He is.
 I do not know you.
 Where will I find the man Uhtred?
 Lord Uhtred will be that way, with the king's guard, and the king, and half the townsfolk starved of interest.
 Argh!
 
 Clapa's a bear.
 A big, angry bear.
 Should we call a halt?
 Not at all.
 With a little luck, a blow will land.
 All he's doing is showing off his feathers.
 I believe the lady feels the same.
 They usually do.
 Even his scars are handsome.
 Yargh!
 
 Ha-ha-ha!
 Not every sword stroke is a kill!
 A kill is something you must fashion.
 Whether man against man, or within a shield wall.
 Anything below the knee is vulnerable.
 A strike to the ankle won't kill you, but it'll open the door.
 And Death himself will step through that door.
 So don't do what Clapa has done, don't overreach.
 Do not make almost half of your body a target.
 Fetch me water.
 Forgive me.
 We're looking for Uhtred, the commander of the king's army.
 We're here to offer our swords.
 Excellent!
 Excellent!
 To whom do you belong?
 We serve the Dane, Earl Brynjar.
 We're settled north and east of here.
 I know of Brynjar.
 Well, I am Guthred, I'm king of Cumberland.
 Lord forgive me.
 No, no, no!
 If you are here to join me, there's nothing to forgive.
 Brynjar's not with you?
 My lord is an old man now.
 He sends you here, why?
 He's worried the like of Kjartan will take his land.
 If King Guthred is against Kjartan, then we're with him.
 Excellent.
 Truly excellent.
 You must be Uhtred.
 I am.
 There's ale and food on the cart, if you're hungry.
 Welcome.
 Lord.
 Welcome!
 We must eat, Father, before the food disappears.
 Indeed.
 They look like good men.
 Fighting men.
 You should bring them into your household guards.
 Fill your bellies.
 You've come far?
 We have.
 I'm Halig.
 I'm hungry.
 I am to become a Christian.
 Like my father before me, I am to be baptised.
 It does you no harm, Lord.
 I've been baptised twice.
 It's water and words.
 Hm!
 Also, I was thinking that I should marry a Saxon.
 Well, to show that Cumberland and Northumbria are for both people.
 That is good.
 Good thinking.
 I would choose Hild.
 I like her.
 But I need someone younger.
 Somebody who's ready to pup.
 You should be with Hild.
 No.
 I should not.
 
 I've seen you look at my sister.
 
 Well, she attracts the eye.
 What can I say?
 Gisela has value.
 As do I.
 Lord, we should march on Eoferwic as soon as we're ready.
 While it's still in Saxon hands and before the brothers return.
 Hm.
 I will speak with the abbot.
 Lord, the abbot is an abbot.
 I am a warrior, you're a king.
 The abbot and his dream is the reason I am king.
 I will speak to the abbot, and my sister shall do her duty.
 Finish this for me, Clapa.
 Lord.
 
 
 Lady Gisela.
 Lord Uhtred.
 May I sit?
 Please.
 Are you a Christian?
 No, I'm not.
 I would sit here to please the abbot, but now I find there's there's peace here.
 I am disturbing you.
 No.
 You're not.
 I was thinking about my brother, and how he now believes he is my father.
 He is the king.
 I do not belong to him.
 He thinks otherwise, but I will not be his gift.
 And you believe you will have a choice?
 I will not be his gift.
 I have my own mind.
 The abbot Eadred dreamt my brother to be king, but it was not his idea to offer a ransom.
 It was not his idea that we should go to Alfred for silver.
 It was you?
 It was.
 Hm!
 That all said, without you, Lord, my brother would not be free.
 
 It's my fate.
 You should call me Uhtred.
 The abbot and your brother will hear of us sitting alone together.
 May I ask should you hear that I am to be offered as a bride, please advise me?
 I will.
 What will you do?
 I will decide whether to stay or to leave.
 And go where?
 I have perhaps said too much.
 Uhtred.
 Lady.
 You may call me Gisela.
 Lord?
 I am to tell you your horse is sickly, Lord.
 
 One cry and you're dead.
 My lords Kjartan and Sven send their greetings, Uhtred Ragnarson.
 We have a long journey ahead of us.
 And you will only see half of it.
 Clapa.
 Clapa!
 The Danes the ugly Danes who were sat there, when did they leave?
 I'm allowed to take an eye.
 Which one would you like to keep?
 The blue one.
 I swear I'll kill you before we reach Kjartan.
 I look forward to seeing you try.
 No!
 I need one of them alive!
 Not you.
 
 This night, evil did visit Cumberland and it was defeated!
 By men who have now proven themselves to be warriors!
 
 This is our first victory and it will not be our last!
 
 It will not be our last!
 So let's celebrate!
 
 Clapa!
 Halig!
 Cut off their heads, put them in a sack and keep them safe.
 I shall make a present of them to Kjartan.
 Yes, Lord.
 Right, you are far from what I would call warriors, but you did well.
 I am grateful.
 Thank you.
 I would like to speak to Lord Uhtred.
 You cannot.
 I would like to serve him.
 You cannot!
 Now shut your mouth, before I fill it, with my boot!
 
 When do you plan to begin?
 When I am drunk.
 Have you done this before?
 Never, but I know it's best to wait, for the blood to thicken.
 I would like to have some of their mail, or leather.
 I will earn it by taking the first head.
 You can take what you want.
 Just take it.
 No, I will earn it.
 You earned it at the stab I need to become accustomed to how it feels.
 Hild!
 We'll be using an axe.
 
 
 
 Lords and Earls of Cumberland, I thank you for showing this great unity.
 Cumberland has, over the years, become a land for both Dane and Saxon.
 Together, with the power of the Christian God, we can achieve great things.
 Amen.
 Amen.
  Amen.
 As your king, I have decided that it's time for our army to march!
 To Eoferwic!
 
 Lord, I am Ulf.
 Ulf?
 My father spoke very well of you.
 Do you have something to say?
 I say we have no enemies in Eoferwic.
 Yet there are many foes who will attack our lands when we are gone.
 I gave you men to protect my land and the land of my neighbours, not to abandon it.
 I have news brought to me from all over Northumbria.
 Our enemies are otherwise occupied.
 Is this news or hearsay?
 The brothers are beyond the Tuede.
 Kjartan the Cruel is locked within his fortress and Aelfric, Lord of Bebbanburg, dare never attack an army that carries the blessed Saint Cuthbert before it.
 What of the Irish?
 What of the Scots?
 
 What of rogues and raiders?
 What of crops in the fields and livestock in the hills?
 Lord Ulf, I have recently come from Eoferwic and I tell you there is great wealth there.
 Silver and the rewards of war horses, swords, land, even.
 And women.
 
 Oh, indeed, women indeed!
 Eoferwic is a sink of corruption, riddled with sin and lascivious women.
 It is a city that will need to be scoured.
 Scoured by this holy army!
 We have the numbers!
 God is with us!
 We shall become richer in body and soul.
 We shall become the masters of Northumbria!
 Onward!
 Yeah!
 Onward!
 To Eoferwic!
 Would you share a jug of ale with me?
 Tomorrow, I must return to Wessex.
 You should stay.
 Northumbria is your home.
 And Alfred is my king.
 You will be safe, travelling?
 Who will you be riding with?
 Two men.
 Warriors?
 Monks.
 But they will each be carrying a heavy cross.
 I will be safe.
 I have these.
 They are teeth belonging to Saint Cuthbert.
 They are a gift for Alfred and my most holy protection.
 Do you believe they still bite?
 No, Uhtred, I simply believe.
 Faith is a great comfort.
 Promise me you won't do anything stupid.
 How can I make a promise that I cannot keep?
 Stupid, it's in my nature.
 You must be tired of hearing my lessons but here's one more.
 You are guided by your heart and it is a good heart, I pray it never darkens.
 The lady Gisela, like Alfred's daughter, Aethelflaed, has a purpose a higher purpose than need or want or even love.
 I have seen what others have seen, the attraction.
 She has her own mind.
 King Guthred may consider you a friend, but the men close to him do not.
 Well, that is no hardship.
 You may have one ear of the king but they will most certainly have the other.
 And as you have witnessed just today, they speak well their words have effect.
 So, go carefully.
 I will say no more.
 Do not change.
 But try to use the mind inside this head.
 Stay.
 You can be my priest, at Bebbanburg?
 You are in need of a priest, are you?
 Only if he is Beocca.
 Go carefully!
 Are the heads are bagged and loaded?
 Getting stinking and attracting flies.
 Lord.
 Where is Hild the nun?
 Has she left us?
 She is here still.
 The body of Saint Cuthbert is coming with us, Lord?
 He is to lead on the shoulders of the monks.
 How are the brave men of Cumberland?
 
 I won't forget how you came to my aid.
 Each of you shall have silver!
 
 But more than that, you have my sword!
 
 He enjoys adoration such vanity is sinful.
 Lord you should know, he and the lady Gisela have shared time together.
 Alone.
 Where?
 A field, a barn?
 In the chapel, Lord.
 Keep watch.
 Should his cock wander and her virginity decide to join it.
 Yes, Lord.
 
 Again.
 Louder.
 
 Louder.
 Why?
 Why not put all of my effort into 
 
 Now do you see, Lady?
 I do.
 Yes.
 Thank you.
 I do not wish to see her married.
 She must.
 Time has passed so quickly.
 Take comfort that Steapa would kill any man who dared to harm her, husbands included.
 He's as much her man, as he is yours.
 Yes, he is.
 Should I have him beheaded as a traitor?
 You!
 Girl!
 Woman!
 Warrior!
 I need to go into the woods there.
 I need to shit!
 I do not wish to fill my breeches!
 Halig.
 Our prisoner requires attention.
 I believe Lord Uhtred is hoping you can tell him about Kjartan's fortress.
 It is tall.
 Tell him that and you're a dead man.
 Then let me speak to him.
 He will speak to you when he is ready!
 He's a good man.
 
 Drop your sword!
 You will fetch Lord Uhtred, tell him I have his man.
 kill me and we are both dead!
 Now!
 Lord Uhtred!
 Lord Uhtred!
 With luck we shall both live.
 I could have killed him, Lord, made good my escape.
 kill him and you will die slowly.
 Told you.
 I asked your man to fetch you, Lord!
 I do not murder.
 I wish to bargain.
 A life for a life, is it?
 My life for my sword.
 I wish to serve you, Lord.
 I could have killed both, but I wish to serve you.
 You are Kjartan's man.
 No.
 I'm Kjartan's bastard son who whelped on a slave girl.
 And you are Uhtred Ragnarson and I wish to serve a warrior and a lord, a true lord.
 If you believe me to be these things, then put down your sword.
 You guarantee my life?
 Put down your sword.
 kill him!
 No!
 Put down your sword.
 I can be of use to you, Lord.
 He's nothing but a heathen kill him!
 No-one is to move!
 kill him now!
 I say no-one is to move!
 And no-one is to speak but me!
 No-one!
 What is your name?
 I'm called Sihtric, Lord.
 Please, I'm not loyal to Kjartan and never can be.
 You swear your sword is mine?
 On Thor's hammer, I do, Lord.
 I swear.
 Then you have my protection.
 Lord.
 Thank you.
 Thank you.
 Sihtric is with us now.
 He serves in King Guthred's army.
 He behaves as if he were king!
 So do you need to shit or not?
 
 
 Tomorrow, Lord, I shall ask Halig and three of our snails to go on ahead, ensure the road is safe.
 The road ahead will be both safe and clear.
 The blessed Saint Cuthbert's path shall not be blocked.
 We are either an army or a church procession, we cannot be both.
 We can be both and we are both.
 We are a holy army.
 Unity, Uhtred, shall bring reward.
 I promise.
 He believes himself to be above the church, above God, even.
 Lord Abbot, he is pagan we do not recognise your God.
 He's a lord without land nor men that makes him dangerous.
 Uhtred has shown himself to be loyal.
 Are you forgetting how my brother was freed from slavery?
 You are flushed, my dear.
 A little lovesick, perhaps?
 Abbot Eadred, you speak too plainly!
 Forgive me.
 Uhtred is an ealdorman.
 He has land, in Wessex.
 But he's born of Northumbria, a deposed ealdorman whose ancestors were indeed kings.
 He believes himself to be your equal, Lord.
 Perhaps more than equal.
 I will leave if you wish.
 I do not wish, but you cannot stay.
 And if I'm quiet?
 We could both be quiet.
 
 
 
 Do you need assistance, Brother Trew?
 No.
 I do not.
 Thank you.
 Sleep well.
 Lord Abbot, the most holy Saint is safe and covered.
 Thank you, Brother.
 Well, I will bid you good night.
 One other small matter.
 I would like you to make a journey, to Bebbanburg to Lord Aelfric.
 Is Aelfric not our enemy?
 Hmm.
 He is our enemy solely because he is Uhtred's enemy and yet he is a Christian.
 Can we say the same of the long-haired peacock?
 To face the Northmen, to face Kjartan the Dane, we will need men, God-fearing men.
 Lord Aelfric could well provide those men.
 I have offered him a bargain, in this letter.
 You will bring me an answer.
 I will, Lord.
 May God be with you.
 They're coming from the north it can only be the brothers, Sigefrid and Erik.
 Not Kjartan?
 No.
 Would you say if it was?
 Two of us should remain here and watch.
 Two of us should return to Uhtred.
 It is not your place to decide what we do.
 Lord Uhtred put me in command.
 Oh, yes, Lord!
 
 Hild, you will return to Uhtred.
 Alone?
 With Sihtric.
 The two of us?
 
 Clapa, shut your ugly Dane mouth.
 Lord, there.
 That is Erik.
 And there is Sigefrid.
 I was right, this is not an army.
 We could attack tonight.
 Surprise them in their sleep.
 They will know Eoferwic is lost.
 Will they?
 Yes.
 That is the man I set free.
 They must have been marching for days.
 Now's a good time.
 An attack is an option, yes.
 It's the only option, Lord.
 They are waiting to be slaughtered.
 Lord?
 There will be no better time to fight than now.
 Uhtred, I'm thinking 
 We must attack.
 Lord, what I'm saying is good advice.
 We must attack tonight.
 Do you not hear me?
 I'm thinking!
 Come.
 I need to wash away the taste of defeat.
 Sigefrid, we are not finished.
 Men will come.
 We will take Eoferwic back.
 The facts are these Sigefrid and his army is not beyond the Tuede.
 It stands between us and Eoferwic.
 But it is not an army.
 We are more than three times their number.
 So we kill them.
 No, we do not kill them.
 We must consider the battles that lie ahead.
 Beyond Sigefrid is Kjartan, beyond Kjartan is Aelfric.
 And what you must do, Lord, is win the first and this could be done this very night.
 I have decided that we shall negotiate.
 We bargain?
 With an army so small?
 The brothers and their men, they are a useful addition to Our own numbers.
 Why do you insist on inviting strangers into the household guard?
 And what of the silver?
 I have made my decision!
 A message has been sent.
 It will mean less silver.
 Ulf, it will mean more silver from Eoferwic, Kjartan and Bebbanburg.
 Bebbanburg and what lies within it belongs to no man but me.
 You are for yourself, it would appear.
 Gisela, I would like you beside me at the negotiation.
 Uhtred, mine is the only voice that the brothers shall hear.
 We should be fighting, not talking.
 I'm Erik, this is my brother Sigefrid.
 I am King Guthred.
 How did you enjoy your war with the Scots?
 You look tired.
 You have a name?
 I'm Uhtred, of Bebbanburg.
 The Danes know me as Uhtred Ragnarson.
 You are the man who killed Ubba?
 I am.
 Thank you.
 We have benefited greatly from Ubba's death.
 He has not been mourned.
 Danes, Northmen and Saxons.
 Priests, pagans a strange mix.
 You might not know this, but in your absence, all Danes and Northmen in Eoferwic have either been killed or fled.
 Eoferwic will be mine.
 There will be no fight none.
 Unless it's with Sigefrid and Erik.
 I will fight you and I will win.
 Then why are you talking?
 The king is a man of the one true God his preference is that we come to an agreement.
 It will need to be a handsome agreement.
 Make your offer.
 In exchange for peace, in compensation for the loss of Eoferwic, I will offer you a fortress, at Dunholm.
 Kjartan is at Dunholm.
 Yes.
 We will join together and we will take it.
 Kjartan's land will become your land.
 You offer nothing.
 Dunholm is too strong, it cannot be taken.
 What I am offering you, Sigefrid, is life, life as an Earl!
 The only way to defeat Kjartan is to deny him food and freedom.
 We, my brother and I, have considered this often.
 You would need to surround him with men, with defences, and deny him what he needs to live.
 Yes, all your men would need to be fed and remain sober, for months.
 It would take too much time and too many men, some hundreds of men.
 But it can be done?
 There are other ways.
 It can be done, yes.
 Then that is what we do.
 Lord, this is not a plan that can be decided upon quickly.
 There are other ways!
 Uhtred, as the king explained earlier, you do not have a voice I will say what's on my mind and clearly!
 This plan can never work there are other ways to defeat Kjartan.
 It seems everyone is wrong but you, Uhtred Ragnarson.
 Do we have a plan, King Guthred?
 Yes, we have a plan and we have an agreement, do we not?
 We do.
 Excellent.
 In addition to Dunholm, how many women will you be offering?
 None.
 Most definitely, none.
 Your hair is unbound, lady.
 You do not have a husband?
 My sister will marry when appropriate.
 
 Excellent.
 Well, hopefully, we will be bonded for a long, long time.
 To peace.
 To peace.
 Once we are settled, Lord, there are matters I would like to discuss, privately.
 Of course just as soon as we're settled.
 See the power of the blessed Saint, Lord.
 In carrying him before you, he has given you this city without a single drop of blood being shed.
 All that is required now is that we praise him.
 Will you join me in prayer, my Lord?
 I will, Abbot Eadred.
 I will.
 Sihtric?
 Yes, Lord?
 Kjartan's fortress at Dunholm you will tell me of the weaknesses.
 There are none, Lord.
 Lord, there are no weaknesses.
 There are always weaknesses.
 I will see for myself.
 Uhtred, I believe, is a threat to your crown a threat even greater than the brothers.
 No!
 No!
 I do not see that.
 I am indebted to Uhtred.
 Lord, we are all in his debt.
 But in helping to free you, did he not also act for himself?
 He believes himself to be above each one of us and he is loved by the men they will follow him.
 I have to say, I worry that Bebbanburg will not be enough for such a man.
 He's a warrior.
 Warriors crave war.
 Whereas we know that Bebbanburg is quite enough for his uncle.
 If it were not for Uhtred, we would have no quarrel with Aelfric.
 None.
 The opposite would apply he would be an ally.
 As for the plan to lay siege to Dunholm I do believe it to be sound, but it will require many further men, and they must be men who will not be tempted to join either Sigefrid or Uhtred.
 Yes.
 May I suggest, Lord, that you summon Christian men?
 Christian men, yes, of course.
 But from where?
 Allow me to think on it, Lord.
 Let us both think on it.
 He is a warrior now my nephew?
 He is, Lord, with reputation.
 Fearsome reputation.
 He talks of me?
 Often, Lord.
 Oh?
 Without affection.
 Wants to tear me apart, no doubt?
 That is the impression he gives, Lord, yes.
 Your king's intention regarding Bebbanburg is what?
 The abbot Eadred, who advises the king, is for peace.
 Mm-hm?
 However, the abbot is on one shoulder, 
 your nephew is on the other.
 And Uhtred wishes me dead.
 He will not rest.
 I know it.
 I've always known it.
 We fear he covets not just Bebbanburg, Lord, but the whole of Northumbria.
 As is the way with Danes.
 It is.
 200 spears?
 Tell your king, tell the abbot I am open to an alliance.
 If King Guthred were to raise an army against Kjartan, I would be prepared to add to that army.
 My business with the Danes has long since finished.
 In return, I shall require the head of Osbert.
 Osbert, Lord?
 My nephew's name is Osbert.
 There shall be no more talk of Uhtred.
 He's not the heir he's nothing.
 The head of Osbert.
 Thank you, Lord.
 It is one of ours, Lord.
 The flesh is rotten, but I know it, I'm sure.
 Go to the others!
 It seems they're all men we know, my Lord!
 Tekil!
 Is he amongst them?
 Go on!
 There are only seven heads.
 There are only seven heads who is missing?
 Fiske!
 The last one is Tekil!
 
 It's him.
 It's the dead Horseman.
 Do you believe you deceive me?!
 I know who you are I know exactly who you are!
 Uhtred Ragnarson!
 I will have your soul, Kjartan!
 Face me!
 Face me like a man!
 Uhtred!
 You asked to speak and then you disappear.
 To breathe, Lord, nothing more.
 We have had a disagreement.
 That is past now, I hope.
 You command my army and you are my friend.
 But I am king.
 Yes, but you cannot be a friend to all men.
 There are times, Lord, when you must be ruthless.
 You speak of Sigefrid and Erik.
 I do.
 They should have been dispatched to Corpse Hall.
 Now they think you're weak.
 Men must fear you.
 Do men fear Alfred?
 He is a good man.
 They fear his displeasure, yes.
 You're right.
 Fear is a beast I must use.
 During my incarceration as a slave, fear lived within me.
 Often.
 It is a feeling that never leaves you.
 It scars.
 It humbles a man.
 I do hear you, Uhtred.
 May I say more, Lord?
 Of course!
 I, er, I wish to be seen as Sigefrid's equal.
 His equal?
 Like the brothers, I am a lord of the north.
 I could easily become your rival.
 Yes.
 I ask that you make peace with me.
 I ask that you offer your sister in marriage.
 The attraction, it is reciprocated, I expect?
 Mm-hmm.
 She feels the same?
 She does, I believe.
 You have been spending time with her?
 We've spoken, yes.
 Then, there can be no argument.
 I hereby officially now see you as a rival.
 A threat to my crown.
 
 Thank you, Lord.
 Thank you.
 
 That's enough!
 Hold them fast!
 Follow me!
 What are you doing?
 I wish to see the king!
 Hild, no!
 No, Hild, put down your sword!
 Put it down now!
 What shall I do, Lord?
 You do nothing.
 Hild!
 My sword!
 And find Gisela!
 Lady Gisela?
 Is it true they have taken Uhtred?
 Out of the way, this is God's work.
 It is!
 Then you must help him!
 You are his only hope!
 Guthred!
 Guthred, whatever your plans, change them.
 You are to be sold.
 We're to be sold?!
 Why?
 Lord, we are your army!
 We saved you!
 It's not lost on me that while you gave me my freedom, I am now taking yours.
 You will become a slave, Uhtred.
 No!
 And Halig with you.
 No!
 No!
 You have no argument with Halig, let him go free.
 No, Lord.
 I will stay beside you.
 Guthred, let him go free.
 I beg you!
 You see?
 This is the reason why you're being caged.
 You inspire loyalty.
 You inspire loyalty from my men.
 Guthred, I gave you my word, my sword.
 But what I need is 200 swords!
 I need 200 men, and that is your worth.
 200 Christian men of Bebbanburg!
 My Uncle Aelfric?
 He asked for your head, but slavery will be enough, I'm sure.
 It would be better to kill me, but you lack the courage.
 kill me.
 Sword in hand.
 My sister would never forgive me.
 kill me!
 Goodbye Osbert.
 Guthred, you should kill me, or I will return, I swear!
 Guthred!
 Guthred!
 You should kill me!
 
 He is lost, Hild.
 I do not readily see how I can help him.
 You cannot.
 But, Lord Hild, he could be across the seas by now.
 It cannot be true he is Uhtred.
 Lord, I will search for him.
 For how long, Beocca?
 For as long as is necessary.
 For a lifetime.
 Why not?
 Beocca, the task is near impossible, and with respect, it is beyond you.
 He is lost, Father.
 No!
 Father, it is Uhtred.
 He kept us safe in the 
 Aethelflaed, shush.
 He did not abandon us and we should not abandon You will be silent now!
 My dear, it is not that I wish to abandon him, it is how do I find him?
 Lord, what of his brother, Ragnar?
 Would he not wish to find Uhtred?
 And he is more capable than Father Beocca.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Ragnar is a hostage!
 And a man of his word.
 Could he not remain a hostage whilst outside of Winchester?
 Earl Ragnar.
 I have a task for you.
 And you alone.
 Move it!
 Move!
 You are no longer a warrior.
 You belong to me now.

02x01 Episode 1
 I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred.
 I was born an Ealdorman of England.
 Our ancestors took this land, and you will die for it, if needed.
 I saw my father killed in battle and my uncle steal his lands.
 I was taken by the invade... first as a slave and then as a son to Earl Ragnar.
 That was my family, my life... young Ragnar, my brother, and Brida, my friend.
 Until my family were murder by Kjartan the Cruel and his one-eyed son, Sven, and my sister taken hostage on the eve of her wedding.
 I fled to Alfred, the Saxon king of Wessex.
 I fell in love with a pagan queen, who saw my sister in a vision.
 Uhtred, she lives, and is being held in the North.
 In the year at Ethandune, I fought alongside King Alfred to defeat the Danes, and drove them from Wessex, but at a great price.
 Uhtred Ragnarson, I have a gift for you.
 Your queen!
 Peace was secured with hostages, Brida and Ragnar, and by the Danish earl's baptism and acceptance of the Christian God.
 As for Uhtred, the godless?
 My path led North, to blood feuds, to revenge... and to Bebbanburg.
 Destiny is all.
 No mercy!
 No mercy!
 Lord?
 Lord, are the ideas suitable?
 I have tried to show both courage and sacrifice.
 Faced with a fearsome enemy.
 But I do not see God.
 He was there, within us all.
 Praise Him.
 Word of the victory is being spread throughout the land.
 People will hear that it was God-given.
 He was amongst us.
 Aethelflaed, with me, before you hurt him.
 Yes, Mother.
 The Witan is full to brimming.
 Every Ealdorman and his brother is here to bask.
 Not all of them deserving.
 Wessex is safe.
 
 But, Ealdormen, to keep Wessex safe, we must now look beyond its borders, to Mercia, East Anglia, to Cornwalum, Wales and to the North, to Northumbria and to the once great and holy city of Eoferwic, where now, Christian men and women suffer under the dark rule of the Danes.
 There are two Northmen, Sigefrid and Erik, two Godless brothers with a voracious appetite for land, silver, slaves and war.
 I want it known...and I want them to know...that God, Alfred and the Ealdormen of Wessex are watching.
 The day of reckoning will come!
 
 Make way, make way.
 Is this the palace of King Alfred?
 Halt!
 Stand back from the king's guard.
 I have a letter that he will wish to read.
 You must let me pass!
 In all too soon a time, Aethelflaed will be old enough for betrothal, then marriage.
 You require a list of suitors, Lord?
 I do.
 They must be a match for my daughter, her mother, for Wessex and my idea of a united land.
 In which order, Lord?
 Oh, do not ask me, my friend.
 I pray I never need to choose.
 I have business with the king.
 Lord, forgive my interruption, may I introduce Brother Trew.
 Lord, I am honoured.
 Brother Trew has travelled from the North.
 Cumbraland, in the west of Northumbria.
 He has a letter that tells of a vision and a prophecy.
 From the heavens, Lord, I swear.
 The abbot Eadred of Cumbraland did dream of the likeness and this likeness did speak to him.
 The likeness was of Saint Cuthbert.
 Cuthbert?
 Speaking directly from heaven.
 The abbot tells of Cuthbert's instruction within the letter.
 Lord, for the Saxons and Britons in the North, there is an urgency.
 We are lost, we are, in general, ruled by Danes, we are in need of a Christian saviour.
 This saviour is Guthred.
 A man who is a lowly slave and who himself must first be saved.
 At the behest of the blessed Cuthbert.
 
 The doors are open to the elements, Brother Trew, nothing more.
 It can be done, Lord, it can be arranged... with your help and guidance.
 And you shall have it, Brother Trew, I'm sure.
 Father Beocca, I will send for you when I have read the letter, which I shall do immediately, do not wander.
 No, Lord.
 Influence beyond Wessex, Odda.
 Heaven sent.
 Come on, move on.
 Move on.
 Come on.
 Good day.
 It is, Sister.
 Your sword.
 It is not your sword.
 You may keep the silver you will have taken, but not the sword.
 You will turn and run, girl.
 I have killed... and I will kill again, I'm sure.
 But hopefully not today... girl.
 Morning, Lord.
 She did the very same thing to me.
 We're leaving.
 Argh!
 Could you not have shook me awake?
 It's time for you to stop drinking and whoring and to do what we set out to do.
 I'm wet!
 Your sword has been stolen, Lord, along with your silver.
 Hild!
 I have recovered Serpent-Breath and when you are able to stand, I shall return her.
 We will be leaving.
 I will decide when we're leaving!
 I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred.
 I will not be schooled by a nun!
 She's not wrong, Lord.
 You have been drinking whole fields of barley.
 Nor will I be lectured by an arseling!
 If you're drinking to forget Iseult, you do her no favours.
 Her memory should be cherished, not lost in a fog of ale and bosoms.
 My sword.
 Are we to ride to Northumbria, or to the next inn and the next jug of ale?
 What am I to do in Northumbria with an army of two, a nun and a rag-arse?
 A loyal rag-arse.
 Prepare yourself.
 To do what?
 kill Kjartan and the men who surround him?
 You can begin to carry yourself as a lord!
 Or we can return to Winchester?
 No, we cannot return to Winchester.
 Did she not say that your path led North?
 Thank you.
 Forgive me, Lord.
 Please, Lord.
 May the gods protect you on your quest.
 What do you know of my gods?
 Nothing, Lord.
 I meant no insult.
 Sigefrid, leave him, he's just a priest.
 Come on, brother, we have Scots to kill.
 Erik!
 The city, we leave in your hands.
 It's ours, it must remain ours.
 I will ensure it.
 You have enough men, keep them sober and do not kill for the fun of it.
 No, Lord.
 You do me a great honour, Lord, though I wish I was going with you.
 Remember, what we need more than silver is women!
 Red-haired women!
 To the shield wall that awaits us!
 To the joy of battle!
 And to the blood of the Scots!
 Ah, Father Hrothweard, we've been waiting for you.
 I will serve.
 We must rise up.
 Every day we hear stories of what has happened in Wessex.
 The brothers have, this very moment, taken their army North.
 They will be gone for months, perhaps.
 There is no better time than now.
 We must take Alfred's lead and kill every bastard Dane and Northman in Eoferwic...in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
 I'm not saying grace!
 It is a battle cry!
 Smoke.
 Come on.
 Danes.
 Danes would not slaughter Danes like this.
 If there is slaughter, Lord, and there appears to be slaughter, why do we ride towards it?
 We are curious.
 Fight the Dane!
 Test your sword-craft!
 Do battle with a turd, directly from the devil's arse!
 You can cut him, but you cannot kill him!
 And if he kills you, then so be it!
 More fool you!
 hit him!
 hit him!
 hit him!
 Go on, hit him!
 Lord?
 Lord, we are Saxons, it's none of our business.
 If it is a fight you want, it can be with me.
 This is Lord Uhtred of Bebbanburg and of Wessex!
 It's sport, Lord, a pastime.
 Your sport is over.
 Pick up your sword.
 Pick it up.
 Lord, this man belongs to me.
 He's my prisoner.
 He was left in command.
 Is it Valhalla you want?
 In time, Lord.
 Freedom would be my first choice.
 Who do you serve?
 The brothers, Sigefrid and Erik.
 They've gone to fight the Scots.
 I beg you, Lord, he will be my income.
 Halig, give this piece of weasel sh1t a coin.
 A coin, Lord?
 He would be my income for a year!
 No more word, I'm warning you!
 Leave now.
 What?
 Go.
 You!
 You!
 State your name and your business!
 You keep the company of a nun, yet look every piece of you a Dane.
 My business is my own and not that of a priest.
 He's Uhtred of Bebbanburg, Father.
 Uhtred?
 You are the Uhtred?
 Who served with Alfred at Ethandun?
 I am.
 Praise Him.
 Praise God!
 It is a sign!
 You know of Ethandun?
 Not only do we know of this battle, Lord, we have risen because of it.
 And just days ago, Alfred has sent his very own priest.
 You killed all the Danes that ruled Eoferwic?
 We have.
 All those that did not flee.
 The holy city of Eoferwic welcomes you.
 We will give you food and shelter and thanks, Lord Uhtred.
 God bless you.
 We take care of the horses... and then I find Alfred's priest.
 We carry it all, we must.
 But what guarantee do we have that he will not steal Alfred's silver?
 None.
 But that's the risk we have to take.
 Have you been stealing from Alfred, Father Beocca?
 Uhtred!
 Oh, my goodness, Uhtred!
 Wow!
 What a joy it is to see you!
 And for me to see your hairless head!
 I have been praying that our paths would cross.
 This is a sign, God's will.
 Brother Trew, this is the man I've been speaking about.
 And here he is!
 In our time of need, he is here!
 We are travelling North with Alfred's blessing and silver.
 It is a ransom to be paid to free a slave... but he is no ordinary slave.
 This man is marked to become a king of Cumbraland.
 His name is Guthred.
 A Dane?
 But a good man, a man of God.
 The spirit of Saint Cuthbert has decreed that Guthred shall be king.
 A prophecy.
 Oh, my good lord.
 He appeared in a dream to the abbot Eadred of Cumbraland.
 He named Guthred as king of both Saxons and Danes.
 How many men is that?
 Hundreds, thousands, perhaps.
 Warriors?
 Some, yes.
 Of course.
 Alfred would not be content with... this man being solely king of Cumbraland.
 Well, yes, Alfred would wish for Guthred's influence to spread across the whole of Northumbria.
 Including here, in Eoferwic.
 Come with us.
 Help us to free Guthred, protect the ransom until it is delivered, and I'm sure that we'll be rewarded.
 Your bargain is with whom?
 A slave master.
 The village in which we are meeting sits on land that belongs to someone from your past.
 Kjartan.
 Kjartan's land will be full of men, warriors.
 Father, who's protected you so far?
 Do you have no guard?
 We have gathered a group of sickly men, who suffer with the White Riff.
 Leprosy is a terrible curse.
 Put these poor creatures in a cart and no man dare approach.
 No-one can imagine the treasure sitting beside the disease.
 Your king, Guthred...
 Kjartan would be his enemy?
 He would.
 It was Kjartan's men killed his father.
 Guthred himself was captured and sold as a slave.
 Then he would be prepared to raise an army against Kjartan?
 He would be an ally, I'm sure.
 As I'm sure Uhtred is, but one man, against many...
 No, no, Uhtred is more than just one man, and he is here for a reason.
 I have come to wish you goodnight, Lord.
 Rest well.
 Stay.
 Stay.
 I have been thinking of Northumbria.
 Eoferwic is the great city of the North.
 To make it Saxon once again would bring hope.
 It would be a beacon.
 Yes.
 A fortress, from which all Danes of the North could be challenged... and England grows.
 Should you not be sleeping, Lord?
 Yes, I should be sleeping.
 I've always intended to ask about the amber on the hilt of your sword.
 Hmm?
 Is it decoration, or something more?
 It was given to me at my birth by my father... to remind me of who I am.
 Who you are, Lord... is defined by what you do, and what you have done has given you reputation.
 Reputation is not a shield.
 I think Father Beocca asks too much.
 No.
 No, it's fate that I am here.
 It was fate you drenched me in water, set us on our way.
 Kjartan will have men at this village, no doubt.
 But he and his one-eyed son, Sven, they murder my family, and they must be faced.
 And I have my sister to find.
 Are you certain she still lives?
 Iseult was certain.
 Then you should sleep.
 Hild.
 I would sleep easier lying next to a woman.
 Shall I fetch another bucket, Lord?
 We move!
 Can you smell the northern sea, boy?
 The Northumbrian air?
 I smell it and I feel it, Father.
 It feels like home.
 That it does.
 I'd prefer you not to look at me, Lord.
 Is it wrong that I look?
 You have beauty.
 And you have an appetite I do not wish to satisfy.
 I'm with you, Lord, because I'm safe with you.
 
 I would like you to teach me how to fight.
 Swordcraft.
 Skill.
 The Danes call it swordskill.
 Then, I would like you to teach me swordskill.
 To help you kill men who stare?
 No, Lord.
 To protect myself and those I care for.
 Yourself included.
 I give to you my heart, my soul and I ask in return...
 We are being followed.
 You are aware of this, I'm sure.
 I am.
 We are?
 By whom?
 Men belonging to Kjartan.
 They are the shepherds, we are the sheep.
 Then it is a trap?
 It is.
 You will enter the slave market alone.
 And then what happens, death?
 I will follow.
 I will be with the lepers.
 You will not be at our side?
 No.
 Your purpose here is to protect us.
 Do they ride?
 You wish to know if the lepers can ride?
 Mm.
 I have no idea!
 Beocca, what is this nonsense?
 If we are to save Guthred and live to see him crowned king, then the slaver and whoever sits with him must fear me.
 They will not bargain.
 And I am but one man.
 So they must fear me and I will choose how.
 Beocca, I will need you to play your part.
 [man] Move on!
 Move it!
 You like this one, huh?
 He's fast and very hard-working.
 Bring another one!
 This one.
 One of my best.
 You like him?
 He's very strong.
 Very young.
 Something for you, huh?
 [man] Horsemen approaching!
 Hello!
 It is my friend, the silver monk.
 And with guests.
 And a woman.
 How pleasing.
 I have forgotten your name, silver monk, but not our price.
 Do you have it?
 Do you have our man Guthred?
 I have your man.
 Of course I have your man.
 Then I will see him.
 No.
 You will give me the silver, now.
 She looks strong.
 I like that.
 The woman is not part of the price.
 Good strong legs... to hold on to my arse.
 I wish to see Guthred.
 Guthred!
 Make yourself known!
 Guthred of Cumbraland!
 Can you hear me?
 I will decide when you see your man.
 You will give us the ransom and you will give it now.
 You will do everything I say.
 You will come down from your horse, girl.
 Too old to keep.
 Take off your skirts.
 I will not.
 Lord, there are horsemen missing.
 What are you saying?
 Men are missing.
 I counted five more horses than are here.
 They must be hiding, Lord.
 Priest... is my man correct?
 There are further horsemen?
 He is correct, Lord.
 But these horsemen, they came from nowhere and asking us to where we were travelling and we prayed that they would leave us, vanish.
 You wanted rid of them?
 Believe me when I say this, they were not of this world, Lord.
 They were not men, like you and I are men.
 What do you mean, they are not men?
 Well, why are you doing that?
 This... signing your god.
 We were asking his protection, Lord, from the horsemen.
 If they're not men, what are they?
 Please, to speak of them may summon them.
 From where?
 You tell me nothing.
 Can we not simply give you the silver and be on our way, Lord, please?
 There is nothing to fear but the lies of a priest.
 I know it.
 
 Lord...
 Oh, dear God in heaven, it is him.
 It is who?
 
 
 
 We come for your souls!
 Your souls.
 Who are you?
 I am Odin's messenger to command.
 I come from Corpse Hall.
 You are Sven Kjartanson?
 You will answer me!
 What do you want with Sven Kjartanson?
 I've been sent to take the souls of both Kjartan and his son.
 attack...
 attack!
 No man shall move, or Sven Kjartanson will die!
 You will all hear me!
 All of you must leave this place.
 Go!
 Or with one touch of my horsemen, you will be cursed!
 Go!
 Urgh!
 You are going nowhere, but to the devil himself.
 I should kill you now.
 I should take you piece by piece.
 No, please, spare me.
 Odin would forgive me, I'm sure of it.
 I will be a changed man.
 I...
 You will never change!
 You cannot change!
 Lord!
 Lord, I beg you.
 That he fears you is enough.
 Let him take that fear to Kjartan.
 May we free the prisoners, Lord, search the pens for a friend, the king?
 You may.
 I have no business with you.
 Thank you, Lord.
 We shall leave this place, just as soon as we have found him.
 It will be for the best.
 Guthred!
 Guthred!
 We are looking for Guthred of Cumbraland, son of Harthacnut.
 I am Guthred.
 How can I help you?
 Lord...
 Is it you?
 We have found you.
 You have, it seems.
 Who are you?
 Find your way home in darkness.
 Urgh!
 Hear me!
 Hear me now!
 A silver coin to any man who will untie me!
 Two coins.
 
 And my father's thanks!
 
 Who is there?
 Name yourself.
 If you are on this land, you will know who I am.
 You will know not to harm me.
 
 Ah...
 
 
 Urgh!
 The priest tells me it is you I must thank for my freedom.
 I did not raise the ransom.
 A ransom was not paid, it goes back to the church.
 Some coins should go to them, the lepers.
 Without them, we'd all be dead.
 As I am apparently now a king, I shall see they are rewarded.
 This is for you.
 The king brings me food.
 Did Alfred not feed you?
 You know of Alfred?
 Aye, every Dane in the land knows of Alfred.
 And while a slave, some of the men recently captured, they spoke of Ethandun.
 They spoke of Uhtred... how he broke a shield wall.
 You should pay a skald to write a song.
 Hm!
 I did that in Mercia.
 I was drunk and the song was tuneless.
 I am indebted.
 My words have no tune, but they're sincere.
 You have brought me back to life.
 Then you owe me.
 I do.
 I do.
 Serve me.
 Serve you?
 Er, join me.
 A king needs a commander.
 Well, think on it...
 Uhtred of Wessex.
 I'm of Bebbanburg.
 Yes, you are.
 You are.
 Is it your intention to build an army?
 Oh, last night I was still a slave.
 Build an army and I will command it, but only if it's your intention to go against all the lords of the north Kjartan.
 But also the brothers and the man who stole my land.
 My own uncle!
 That, I owe you...
 Uhtred of Bebbanburg.
 Now I must get used to who I am.
 Enjoy.
 Why would a dead horseman ride with sickly lepers?
 Were they dead, too?
 I did not ask.
 He need ride with no man.
 He's dead.
 Invincible.
 Father, it was as I say.
 I know what I witnessed.
 How are we to kill a dead man?
 Cut him into pieces.
 Tiny...
 It's a trick!
 He's a lie!
 
 Go shut her up!
 Your bitch!
 It did not appear to be a trick.
 Everything I've said is true.
 You, Fiske... do you believe this horseman is back from the dead?
 Yes, Lord, it seemed that way.
 Then you believe he was sent by Odin to take my soul?
 Well, he arrived with a priest and a ransom?
 Yes, Lord.
 But no silver was paid?
 No, Lord.
 Still, they took their man.
 We find the slave.
 We find the lepers.
 And we find the priest.
 Together, they will tell us all we need to know about this horseman.
 dead... or otherwise.
 
 You are not welcome here.
 You are never welcome here.
 My father asks for you to keep the hounds quiet.
 Thyra... if you do not comply, he will have them killed again.
 And again, you shall bring me pups.
 He will have men hump you.
 I tell you every time... you do not need to live like this.
 You don't need to eat and sleep with hounds.
 It is my wish.
 
 I dream of you... as you were.
 I dream of nothing but the fire.
 My wedding necklace... do you like it?
 If any love for me remains inside your shrivelled heart, then take out your knife and kill me.
 
 
 
 
 
 So you know of the Northmen Sigefrid and Erik?
 They have gone to Alba to fight the Scots.
 A mistake.
 Yes, they will lose numbers.
 The men they left at Eoferwic have been slain.
 It's open and unguarded.
 Only my second day as king of Cumbraland, already you wish me to become king of Eoferwic?
 Why wait?
 The brothers will return, weakened or not.
 I'd rather they remain outside the walls of Eoferwic.
 Lord!
 Lord, the Roman wall!
 We follow the wall all the way to Cumbraland.
 Home.
 And then, Uhtred, we prepare to take Eoferwic.
 Your king!
 Your king, he is coming!
 Prepare!
 Your king!
 He will be here soon.
 Be sure to greet him.
 Make him feel welcome.
 The abbot... where is the abbot?
 Brother Trew.
 Lady Gisela.
 You appear to have news.
 Lady, I do.
 Great news!
 What?
 He's here.
 Who?
 Your brother, the king.
 He lives?
 Oh, he is well and he is near, very near.
 I must inform Abbot Eadred.
 Lord Abbot... he is here.
 They believe you to be the king, Lord.
 Then let him be the king.
 King for the day.
 Thank you, King!
 Thank you.
 Thank you and may God bless you all.
 Uhtred, that is almost blasphemy.
 Thank you all for taking the time to greet the king.
 You will stop this nonsense.
 Beocca, they love me!
 Because they have no idea what a fool you are!
 Be careful, priest, or he will have your head.
 Not before he feels my boot!
 And may I present to you Queen Hild of the water bucket, scourge of slavers and once thrown out of the nunnery!
 I was not!
 The Lord tells lies and all too easily.
 I will be the first to greet him formally.
 You will all wait upon my word.
 Yes, Lord.
 Lord King!
 Lord King!
 Lord King, I am the abbot Eadred.
 Abbot, no...
 It is I to whom the blessed Saint Cuthbert appeared in a dream, a glorious dream.
 Abbot, please...
 He showed me your face... and he called you King.
 Thank you.
 Are you sure... that it was not this face here that you saw?
 What?
 Guthred... it is you!
 I didn't dare to believe it.
 I didn't dare.
 It is the truth.
 This is Guthred.
 Yes, of course.
 Of course!
 Now I see the true likeness.
 Forgive me, Lord.
 I have the eyes of an old man.
 Lord King, I am the abbot Eadred.
 And it is I to whom...
 the blessed Saint Cuthbert...
 Abbot Eadred...
 I have been told of your dream.
 You... must be a most holy man.
 You have truly been blessed.
 I have, my Lord, it is true.
 But let us waste no more time.
 We have waited long enough already.
 Lord, you shall be crowned king this very day, this very moment!
 The king, whom I promised, son of the great warrior Harthacnut, has arrived!
 The king, who shall lead us all, both Dane and Saxon, against the evil that resides in Northumbria... is here.
 With this sword, the sword of Cumbraland, and with the grace of God, may you find the strength to lead and inspire all men.
 Amen.
 Amen.
 And now, Lord, we shall enter the church for the royal oath, which shall be sworn upon the corpse of the blessed Saint Cuthbert himself.
 Cuthbert...
 He is here?
 In his entirety.
 God in heaven...
 I never thought I would see the day.
 Is it him, Father?
 It is.
 years after his death, he remains whole.
 A sign of the depth of his holiness.
 Oh, most holy Cuthbert...
 guide us and lead us and bring us to your glory, in the name of him who died for us.
 Amen.
  Amen.
 See how the flesh is uncorrupted.
 A miracle.
 You will take his hand, Lord... and swear your oath.
 Uhtred... you are the commander of my household troops.
 You will be beside me.
 Uhtred, you will kneel.
 Take his hand, Lord.
 God and the blessed Saint Cuthbert have given us this day a king.
 A king who shall raise an army and that army shall march in his name and all evil shall be expunged!
 This... you swear.
 I swear.
 Vivat Rex Guthred!
  Vivat Rex Guthred!
 Vivat Rex Guthred!
 Vivat Rex Guthred!
 Vivat Rex Guthred!
 Vivat Rex Guthred!
 Guthred...
 Or do I now call you Lord?
 You can call me whatever pleases you.
 Very well, Lord Goose sh1t, I am about to retire.
 Hild will stay with me.
 Yes.
 It is so good to see your crooked little face again.
 It is so good to see that you are still a fool.
 Sleep well.
 Sleep well.
 Goodnight.
 Sleep well, Lady.
 Do not get overly drunk, Lord, for tomorrow you teach me sword-skills.
 And maybe one day I shall save your life.
 Your sister is pretty.
 Uhtred, I believe you would find a goat in a skirt to be pretty.
 Goodnight.
 The cocksure long-haired fool over there.
 Is he a danger?
 To whom, Abbot?
 To each one of us, and to our purpose.
 Although he lacks humility, Uhtred is the reason we are alive.
 Ah, he gave you protection out of the goodness of his heart, did he?
 What does he want with Cumbraland and with our king?
 He wants Bebbanburg, his ancestral home.
 And it's in the king's gift to help him.
 Hm.
 He will need to be watched.
 He's a pretender, I'm sure.
 Please...
 You have men in Northumbria still?
 Some.
 Most have settled, but they are mine to call upon and I have men in East Anglia, with Earl Guthrum.
 His name is now Aethelstan.
 That may be his Christian name, Lord.
 But to us, he's Guthrum... the weak.
 To seek peace is not a weakness.
 The battle of Ethandun was ours to win.
 Only with peace can you build.
 Only with peace can a people grow.
 Grow fat?
 Grow as one, Brida.
 It is true that, in parts of the North, Saxon, Dane and Briton now live side by side, do they not?
 Oh, they do, but it is the Danes that rule.
 Though warlords must now look elsewhere for war, to Ireland and Alba.
 war is how a man makes his wealth.
 I disagree.
 war is how a man takes his wealth, Earl Ragnar, it is the land and trade that makes it.
 And for the land and trade to flourish, there must be peace.
 To be Viking is a way of life.
 To be Viking is a way to die.
 And there are many Danes, I believe, who want more from life than death.
 Lord... you are never more alive than when you sail a ship onto a new shore.
 Oh, on that we are agreed.
 Father!
 Father, I have news of the slave, Guthred.
 He's been made a king, of Cumbraland.
 Fiske?
 It is true, Lord, we heard it from traders.
 Where are these traders?
 We heard the same story three times, five times...
 We heard it three times.
 This Guthred is now a king.
 What of the dead horseman?
 Lord...
 King Guthred is building up an army... made up of both Danes and Saxons.
 And the commander of this army is just that... both Dane and Saxon.
 His name is Uhtred.
 Are you certain of this?
 Yes.
 Tekil...
 Lord?
 If the king of Cumbraland is building an army, you will join him.
 If you get the chance, you can kill the king.
 But you will bring his commander back here, to me.
 Take his eye.
 Yes.
 You can take his eye... but I want him here and I want him alive.
 I will take him piece by piece.
 I will make him suffer.
 Uhtred Ragnarson...is mine.

SEASON: 01
EPISODE: 08
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I'm Uhtred, son of Uhtred. I was born a Saxon Lord, but raised as a Dane until the Eve of my sister's wedding when my family were murder.
[man] Oh!
I am a warrior. But when the Danes attacked Alfred's stronghold of Winchester, all a man could do was run. Some faster than others, including my enemy, young Odda. And so Guthrum took Winchester. Aethelwold pledged his allegiance to the Danes, though Guthrum still feared Alfred's God, I could only hope my now distant wife and child would be safe. We had no choice but to hide and pray for a miracle. Iseult, my virgin queen, saved the King's son, but at a cost only she could see. She gave Alfred strength. With the King alive and well, there is hope for Wessex. Destiny is all.
Agree we have fired a good number of ships.
Fleet.
A fleet.
But in the meantime, we have left hundreds of Danes stranded in Wessex with no means of leaving.
Wulfhere, I did not believe their intention was to ever leave.
And in a few months, there'll be more ships, more men.
Now is the time to fight.
To fight with what?
We're without an army, and the Danes will number thousands.
Men are out there, Wulfhere, and they're waiting.
What they need is the call.
Indeed, but...
Lord... what if I suggest we escort you to Francia...
That will not happen. I will not hide.
Not here, nor in Francia.
But my Lord...
I have prayed daily for guidance.
The only way I see to save Wessex is with what we have begun.
One defining battle.
We shall be leaving the marshes.
Courage and faith.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Father Beocca?
Father...
I'm not saying I know everything... but the King must continue to trust me.
The arrival of Asser may change him.
The arrival of brother Asser has given him strength.
Brother's not a warrior. Now is the time for warriors.
Though I never thought I'd say it, we need Odda the younger.
He commands the largest feared.
He's the beginning of our army.
That is where we're headed.
Uhtred, I will do everything I can to help.
I will be at your side.
I'll be a flea in Alfred's ear.
Thank you.
Your father would be a proud man.
As am I.
I shall ready my man, and by tomorrow, have horses waiting.
Uhtred.
You believe the Danes can be defeated?
I'll see you across the water, ealdorman Wulfhere.
You will.
Why'd you take it?!
_
Aethelgard, Aethelgard, my friend.
A man who be King of Wessex.
Thank you. Thank you for coming to see me.
Lord, it is Aethelwold.
Yes, please, sit down, sit down.
So...
I want you to tell me everything you know about Alfred.
I've told you, Lord, he thinks with his dick.
And he can barely keep his britches on.
Hear the question, boy.
Not everybody enjoys a fool.
Alfred... though he may be afflicted by pain, he's as strong a man as you will find.
He's also as clever a man as you will find.
Yeah, I was ready to have him as my advisor until he stole my crown.
His strength, Lord, I believe, comes from his faith.
 
From God. 
Do you believe... in this God?
I believe in myself.
Why did Alfred steal the crown?
For silver, or to be a stronger King to the people?
No. Um, uh... yes, yes, in part.
Which is it?
Unfairly, I was not seen as a man to follow, by some.
I was not a man to fight Danes, it was said.
And which is true, because I know the Danes will win.
Yes.
Yeah, whereas Alfred, Alfred believes that he can win.
Even now?
Yes.
Yeah, he's wrong, of course, but... but his faith, you know, that God will not desert him, make him believe that he will win.
Then you have to kill him.
I must kill him?
Who else?
Then King Aethelgard can walk in to Alfred's camp... and be welcomed...
As a friend.
 
Wulfhere and his men.
God... stay! Stay away!
I have skills!
Put that piece of tin away, boy.
Oh, thank Christ you're English.
I thought you were one of them... what with the hair.
Where's the ealdorman Wulfhere?
Gone, Lord.
I am Halig. I take care of the horses.
Gone where?
Now, I'm thinking on it, Lord, he did not say.
I thought you would know.
Wulfhere, where is he?
He's gone, Lord.
Lord!
He has gone where?
He didn't say.
He has left your horses, Lord.
We keep moving.
Without Wulfhere?
Our plan doesn't change.
We make our way to Odda's estate.
 
We cannot use the Roman roads.
We can make our way to my farmstead.
And from there, across covered ground to Odda's.
And that is the safest pass, Leofric?
It is, Lord.
Let's return to the others.
 
There is pain here for you, my love.
Do you know them?
Tenants.
No.
No!
No!
We shall bury the dead.
Pray for their souls.
[Beocca] When you are ready...
I would like to say a prayer for Uhtred, son of Uhtred.
I must search for Mildrith.
She may be dead and unburied.
You shouldn't, no. No.
She has buried your son with care, and she has left this place.
It was no longer home for her anymore.
Believe me.
Your tears on the earth will show him that you loved him.
Lord, may I ask what you're writing?
The first of many letters.
Each will say the same.
The men of Wessex and beyond shall gather at Egbert's stone, and together, we will fight.
When you send out your messengers, Lord, might I suggest that you hand them the letters personally.
Perhaps place a hand on their shoulder?
It will embolden them, I'm sure.
Thank you, Beocca.
I will do that.
You know I did this to you when I saved the King's son.
You did not.
I knew an innocent would die.
I'm tired of being like this.
I've seen too much and know too much.
I want to see no more.
[Odda] Mildrith?
_
Mildrith?!
Mildrith?!
Lord, you should be resting.
We should all be resting.
I'm tired of resting.
I've spent too many days doing nothing.
Then at least sit before you become unsteady.
Where's my wife?
She's resting, Lord.
My son?
He's away, Lord.
Still?
Important business demands time.
It is not a betrayal.
No, 'tis not, Lord.
You are Earl Skorpa.
You are here to surrender and not waste my time.
I'm here to negotiate.
Surrender, and you will live.
Talk too much, and I will kill you.
Of all the ealdorman of Wessex, I am the man who can assemble the greatest feared, the greatest army.
I now have to make a choice... whether to side with Guthrum or with Skorpa.
One Dane looks much like the other to me.
I am occupying your land.
Why should I not simply crush you?
Accept my invitation.
Eat with myself and with my father, and I will tell you all about my land.
The range of my influence.
I am sure an agreement can be reached.
Neither of us need lose any men.
Neither of us need be weakened.
Eat and drink at my hall.
I assure you this is no trap.
I will arrive at your hall after the new moon.
I shall expect you.
Then we have peace... at least for a time?
Oh, we do.
You have lost much.
Fathers, mothers.
A son.
Lovers.
I have you.
I have a brother.
Ragnar.
Yes.
Your sister, Thyra.
Yes.
She is alive?
No, she's dead.
In a fire.
Uhtred, she lives and is being held in the north.
Skorpa told me.
I thought at first it could be a lie to torment you.
But now I know that it is true.
She lives.
You've seen it?
Yes. I've seen her.
But I will see her no more. The gift is fading.
When this battle is done, Uhtred, your path leads north.
It will be time to face your past.
And you'll be with me.
Always.
Lord... if God's help is required, how could he look favorably upon Uhtred, a non-believer?
God is good.
Death could be waiting over the very next hill, and it will be Uhtred who stands in its way.
There's no doubt... a Dane will always protect his plunder.
The King is of value.
He is here to protect the King, something neither you or I could do.
He is a man without a soul.
Then I will be his soul, Lord. I will pray for him.
I will ride beside him always and into battle.
I will be his conduit to God.
And if you fall in battle?
With the help of your prayers, brother, I shall become invincible, I'm sure.
Brother Asser...
I should like you to be the first of my messengers.
Morning.
Sleep well?
He means, did you hump well?
I know what he means.
Sleep well, lady?
[Alfred] If I may speak... to you all.
Though we are yet to complete the first segment of our journey to Odda's estate, it is important we begin the second.
Word of our army's gathering point must be dispatched to the further reaches of our land.
Brother Asser here will be my first messenger.
Halig.
Yes, Lord?
You... will also be my voice.
I will, Lord.
And me, Lord.
Hild?
Lord... she's a woman.
I'm as good a horseman as anyone here.
If it means more Danes will die, then I'll do it.
Yes, Hild.
You will.
 
Your horses... belong to whom?
The Lord Odda.
You will let us pass.
You selling or buying?
Selling.
To the Danes.
There is a peace.
Did you not know?
Odda has made a peace?
No, I did not.
Odda is loyal.
We shall see for ourselves what is true.
Lord... you should remain out of sight until we can be sure of your safety.
Odda is not a danger.
But who sits with Odda?
Very well.
I must see this with my own eyes.
Lord, that is not... I've made up my mind.
If there is treachery, it is something I must witness.
Then I will go with you.
I do not require a nursemaid.
I'm a priest. And I a King.
You'll wait here with Iseult.
I am aware of the care I need to take.
Nuns should not be so pretty, nor have lips that demand to be kissed.
I see you agree.
When is it you're leaving?
When I'm rested, Lord.
Lord.
[Odda] What is it?
Have the Danes arrived?
Leofric. He's outside.
Then bring him inside. He's our man.
He's with Uhtred.
Bring them both to me.
Leofric!
Uhtred, my prayers have been answered!
God is good.
Lords... it is good to see you both safe and well.
Leofric, you are home.
Where in God's name have you been?
Hiding, Lord, and killing Danes.
Hopefully not on my land.
[Uhtred] We've been sent by the King.
We bring orders from the King.
What King is that?
King Alfred?
Who else, Lord?
Wessex, it seems, is full of kings.
There is Guthrum, who is King of East Anglia, who now sits in Winchester.
There is Aethelwold here who will tell anyone who cares to listen that he is King.
Where will it end?
I have Alfred's written order.
It means nothing.
You are to raise the feared.
It is over for Alfred!
Alfred gave up in Wessex.
He decided to save himself!
No man has been more loyal to Alfred than my father and I!
But he has failed us!
Danes surround us, and he is hiding.
Alfred is King of the Eels... slippery and elusive.
I see it's true.
You have sided with the Danes.
What has Skorpa promised you?
Are you to be King, Odda?
Leofric, are you stay...
Am I right?
I asked you a question, Leofric.
I am still your man, Lord.
Then you will finish the business you have with this Dane and kill him.
You have my order... kill him.
Lord, I cannot do that.
I stand here as Alfred's messenger...
I will not tell you again, Leofric.
If any man tried to kill me, then that man is a traitor to the King.
Leofric, you will kill him.
Alfred is no longer my King!
I will not do it, Lord.
My son.
Father, you will not interfere.
May your mother forgive me, and may you be forgiven for your treason.
Lord.
Forgive him.
Let him die noble.
Odda... you will do as I command.
You will raise the somerset feared.
Lord, forgive my son!
Please!
I will not forgive what I have seen.
You will raise the feared.
Yes, Lord.
I will need 20 horsemen... to take word to all men able to carry sword, hook, or spear.
The word is that Alfred is King!
 King Alfred!
And will fight alongside the swords of Wessex to his dying breath!
Come on!
May we speak?
About our son.
You know?
Then there is nothing left to say.
I'm sorry that his death was something that you had to face alone.
 I was not alone.
Being without a husband does not mean that I am alone.
And I am sorry for the life that I have given you.
I've found peace.
I hope you can do the same.
Was there sickness?
I would like to understand.
Children are frail.
And you'll have other sons, I'm sure... with your queen.
Is she here?
Yes.
I would like you to leave me alone.
Never speak to me again.
We have nothing that binds us, nothing.
Avoid me, please.
 
Uhtred Ragnarson.
Should I be pleased to see you?
Skorpa of the white horse.
I am expected. By the Lord Odda.
The Lord Odda's in the ground, buried as a traitor.
So what now?
Do I speak with you?
Does the truce stand?
For today, it stands.
Tomorrow, we'll kill you.
You will kill me?
With what?
I have almost 1,000 men to call upon.
Your ships have been burned, Skorpa... by Alfred.
He's gathering a great Saxon army.
I am aware my ships are gone.
And I will have my revenge.
You should return to Guthrum and prepare to die.
Did your queen tell you... that your sister is being humped in the ass each and every night by one-eyed Sven?
[Beocca] Did your mother tell you that she should have kept her legs closed?
I will look for you first across the battlefield!
I will be there!
And I will not be difficult to find!
[Alfred] He will go to Guthrum?
I believe he will, Lord.
Then the battle is one step nearer.
Beocca... you should wash out your mouth.
Yes, Lord, I will.
With ale.
 
How many men?
400. No more.
And this is a great Saxon army?
Their numbers will grow.
We need to march.
There needs to be a story of a slaughter.
Only days ago, Ragnar was asking if the war was over.
Oh, Skorpa is right. There must be a slaughter.
We must take the fight to Alfred and his God.
And you are ready to kill your brother?
If it comes to that, yes.
Then we should face one great honor with another.
Once the armies are assembled, I shall speak to them as one.
Each man should know... this war is not only about land.
Should the heathens win, then Christ is defeated.
When you speak to the men, Lord, you cannot make it a sermon.
And what do you suggest I say?
Tell them that you'll die for them.
That's good.
Tell them that we'll make the Danes pay in blood, and that they'll be rewarded in plunder.
I am to talk of revenge and greed?
They're men, Lord, not angels.
We shall stop for a moment.
Halt! We hold!
It is Egbert's stone.
Within these next few yards, we will know if we have an army... of angels or otherwise.
I will go alone.
If no one is there, what then?
I see.
Not a single one.
Not a single man has answered my call.
Then we wait.
We must wait, Lord.
A fine knife.
A dane's knife.
This thing?
Yes, I took it from a Dane.
A Dane I killed.
Where?
Winchester.
This is before you groveled on your ass to Guthrum?
Before I presented myself to him, yes.
I was not, however, treated in a kingly manner and decided to escape.
The King under the Danes is not King.
Uhtred, I do like you, but I rather tire of your preaching.
You ever thought of becoming a priest?
Ever since I was a boy.
That's a lie. I baptized him twice.
He's still not a Christian.
For luck.
Now I'll need a lock from you.
Where's Alfred?
Watching.
Waiting for his army.
I think I shall go and sit with him a while.
You are fond of him now?
For luck.
 
Lord.
I thought you would like company.
What do you see? What do you hear?
I hear nothing, Lord.
No, no.
There is a change in the shadows and the air.
They are out there.
I see nothing but grass, Lord.
And beyond the grass, trees.
There, there!
It's men.
And more men there.
They have answered the call.
They have answered the call.
The swords of England are coming.
It's the swords of Wessex.
 
The swords of England.
Today is a day for warriors... a day to kill your enemies.
A day we make the pagans wish they had never heard of Wessex.
Today, we fight for Wessex!
And not only for Wessex.
We have men here from Northumbria, from Mercia, from East Anglia.
And why are the pagans here?
They want your wives for their pleasure.
They want your children as their slaves!
They want your homes as their own!
But they do not know us!
Yeah!
They do not know our swords!
They do not know our axes, our Spears.
They do not know our courage.
And today... we kill them!
We shall make the ground red with their blood!
We shall strip them of what they have plundered!
We shall make them cry out for mercy, and there will be none!
No mercy!
No mercy, no mercy!
Should I fall, you and... are to take my horse and ride clear of here.
You will not fall. I forbid this.
Every I have is packed in my bags, it's yours.
You will not fail.
I fight for you.
kill them all!
Then no mercy it must be.
Should you meet Uhtred in battle, there can be no doubt.
No mercy.
None.
We should not be holding back, Lord.
We should attack with every man.
I will decide how we fight.
You will follow my orders.
Yes, Lord.
No mercy.
Form our lines.
Form our lines!
Shields up!
Advance!
Come on!
Forward.
Hold the line! We work as one!
We do not break!
Shields lock!
Hold the line!
Halt!
Halt!
Wulfhere! I will have your guts, you traitorous bastard!
This is our land!
Second!
Third!
First in line, as you wished.
Hmm.
Here they come.
Hold.
Hold!
Keep the wall tight!
Have that, Wulfhere, ya bastard!
Hold!
Leofric!
Leofric?!
Leave him! Leave him!
Narrow the gap!
Keep the wall tight!
Advance!
Three, two, one!
No mercy!
No more ground should be lost!
Follow me!
God have mercy!
 
We fall back as one!
Release!
Release!
Hold!
We hold here! We go no further!
Hold!
Edge backwards with me with my level!
And...
[Skorpa] Uhtred Ragnarson!
Can you hear me?
I hear you, Skorpa!
Do you wish to surrender?
I have a gift for you.
Your queen!
No mercy!
You will be struck down with my spear!
And you will spend eternity in the fires of hell!
Uhtred!
Take the horse.
 
Lord! What are your orders?
Lord?!
Did you see that?
He came, as the priest said.
What, Lord?
Their God is with them.
So what are your orders?
No, Lord.
 
No!
No mercy!
No mercy!
His grave is to be marked like that of an ealdorman.
I shall see to it.
Uhtred.
Iseult is whole.
She has been wrapped and made ready for burial.
I want her to have a pyre.
Then she shall have it.
Uhtred... for all that you have done... all that you've shown me, thank you.
You have given everything.
You are the man I always hoped you would become.
In the year 878 at Ethandun, King Alfred defeated Guthrum of the Danes and drove them from Wessex.
I am indebted, Uhtred of Bebbanburg.
Wessex is indebted.
There can be no negotiation, Lord.
Only surrender.
That is your advice?
It is.
I hear you.
Lord.
Peace was secured with hostages, including my friend Brida and my brother, young Ragnar. Peace was further secured by Earl Guthrum's baptism and acceptance of the Christian God.
Do you renounce the devil and all his work?
I do.
Let this water cleanse you and make you worthy of God's blessing.
Guthrum, you are now a child of God.
 Amen.
As for Uhtred the godless... my journey continues... My path's leads north... to blood fields. To revenge... and to Bebbanburg. Destiny is all.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[Uhtred]  I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred. I was born a Saxon Lord, but raised by Danes as a warrior. I now serve Alfred, the Saxon king of Wessex, and protect his last kingdom of England from Guthrum and his Viking army. But not all believe in the King.
I am my father's heir.
To some, I am seen as an enemy within.
With luck, he will fall in battle.
It is a court without justice, where I will always be seen a pagan, even through the eyes of my pious and now distant wife. And so to pay off the debt on my land, I plundered as a Viking would. And I found a Pagan Queen. A Seer, whose gift is linked to her purity.
She's not to hump.
I am now called a traitor.
I, Brother Asser, swear these oaths.
Alfred's court decided I should be executed.
I request that he dies at my sword.
You will fight to the death.
Destiny is all.
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
Get out, you drunk bastard!
(DRUNKARD GRUNTS)
Is he here?
With a woman who's not his wife.
Your friend is here.
May I sit?
Will I spoil the gift of a last night of freedom?
Sit.
Do you believe I have betrayed you, Arseling?
I don't.
Make no mistake.
Odda had 20 men or more ready to swear against you.
I am here to tell you that I am better than you right now.
I will kill you.
Warrior's death is all I can give.
Forgive me, but I'm trying to forget you're my friend.
As long as you understand.
If you have more to say, you should say it.
[Uhtred] Leofric!
Leofric!
This isn't a fight I want.
I've been allowed my freedom tonight and if I could slip away, I would, but I cannot do that.
Reputation is all.
I know it.
I have feuds to settle, promises to keep. I must live.
Then you must kill me.
And you me.
I intend to.
I will have the advantage.
The king's wife is praying for me. God loves her.
Someone's got to.
It's been good to have you as my friend.
I'll make your death quick and painless.
And then hump my queen?
And your wife.
But you will be without your balls.
I will see you tomorrow morning.
You will.
What are you thinking?
I was thinking how I would like to lie with you...
As a woman.
You were?
I cannot.
Yes, you can.
I cannot.
You know I cannot.
I will lose my gift.
Who cares?
The future is fate, it won't change.
And if today I die?
I have not seen your death.
[Beocca] Uhtred.
Uhtred.
The King wishes to speak with you.
About what?
He's unsure what to wear this morning, he needs your advice.
With me.
[Alfred] Are you going to eat all of this... (BABY COUGHING) ...or shall we save half for Edward?
He's a baby.
Oh, is he? Is he really?
I had quite forgotten.
Ah. Uhtred.
[Uhtred] Lord.
Trust you slept well.
I did not.
My son is coughing and two of my best warriors will, today, try to kill each other.
Today is the Feast of Saint Cedd.
We have decorated the Great Hall. Do you know of Saint Cedd?
No, Lord.
Well, I like to think of him as a symbol.
He worked in East Anglia and Mercia and he died in Northumbria, your part of the country.
A man of all England.
Exactly, Uhtred.
Which is why I am loathe to shed Saxon blood on his day of days.
Resume your debt.
Dispatch your queen back to Cornwalum and there need be no bloodshed.
Those are my terms and they will not change.
If Iseult returns to Cornwalum, she'll be killed.
I'm prepared to resume my debt to save Leofric.
But Iseult must stay with me.
She is plunder. And as such, she must be returned, regardless of her fate.
I can't abandon her. The Queen stays with me.
You are a fool.
You are a sinner and a heathen, and I...
I have lost my patience with you.
The fight will go ahead.
May your soul receive its just reward.
Lord.
(CROWD CHEERING)
 Make way. Make way.
(CHILDREN LAUGHING)
Silence!
Your Majesty, Lords, Ladies.
Great unwashed and stinking people of Winchester.
(ALL LAUGH)
We are gathered to witness justice.
We are gathered to witness a fight to the end.
That end being death. That end being the fires of hell.
We are here to witness a battle between Uhtred, the Godless... (CROWD BOOING) ...and Leofric of Winchester!
(CROWD CHEERING)
Take your shields.
Warriors. Are you prepared?
I am.
Yes.
It is to the death. No matter how death occurs.
May God choose his victor.
Swords.
Begin!

[Aelfric] Brother Asser, I wish you well on your return to Cornwalum.

I wish to walk with them.

[man] The Danes! The Danes are here!
They've breached the city walls! Save yourselves!
The fight is finished, Arseling! Come on, run!
Stand to your man! They are not to pass!
They are not to approach the palace!
Father, they will hack the likes of us to pieces.
The King! Where is the King?
The King will have to make his own arrangements.
And what of me? Odda? Odda!
[Uhtred] Leofric, this way.
(GRUNTING)
(GIRL SCREAMS)
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)
Not me!
(GRUNTING)
Go, quickly.
There'll be nothing left in the stab but horse shit!
Let's go this way.
(WOMEN SCREAM)
(GRUNTING)
We hide here, wait for nightfall.
(MAN SCREAMS)
 Hurry!
I want the King and I want him alive, crawling on his knees!
(WOMAN STRUGGLING)
(AETHELWOLD CHUCKLES)
[Guthrum] Find me Alfred!
(MEN SHOUTING)
Keep away. Keep away.
Stand back, I'm warning you.
God will protect me. God will...
(SCREAMS)
(SOBBING)
(PANTING)
Only Guthrum can save you.
Guthrum is your God now.
Should I spare you?
Please.
(SOBBING)
Go in peace.
Go.
Find Alfred.
(SOLDIER SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
(CLATTERING)
You are Guthrum, the great warrior.
I am Aethelwold.
Son of King Aethelred and rightful king of Wessex.
Alfred stole my crown.
This crown.
As King...
I am prepared to negotiate.
Enough negotiation.
(SNIFFS)
You smell like you have shit yourself.
I have not been well.
(GRUNTS)
I pledge to you my allegiance...
No! Let go of me! No!
(NUN SCREAMING)
Let go! No!
No! No! No! No!
(CONTINUES SCREAMING)
Iseult!
[man] Look out!
[Iseult] It's over.
(SCREAMS)
[Iseult] They're gone.
(PANTING)
We need to be gone ourselves.
Put on a helmet. We're Danes.
Again?
You will not be leaving me.
We will not.
You are prisoners.
(DOG BARKING)
(HORSE NEIGHING)
(MAN LAUGHING)
(WOMAN SCREAMING)
[Brida] Uhtred the Saxon.
Brida.
What's this?
You mean to do me harm?
I haven't decided.
Good to see you again, Brida.
Leofric.
How did you manage to get such a big head into such a small helmet?
It was necessary.
Where's Ragnar? Is he here?
He's almost ready to travel north.
To kill Kjartan?
What do you care?
The guards at the gates will be drunk.
Your way is clear.
Brida...
Tell Ragnar I'm still his brother.
I'll tell him you were here and that you left.
Arseling.
[Leofric] Brida is changed.
She was always angry.
Now she is nasty.
(CLEARS THROAT) Either she has changed, or I have changed.
She once loved you.
Not any more.
Even I could see that much.
I hate the forest.
Is the King likely to have been killed?
The King's not our concern.
If the King is dead, then Wessex is dead.
Where are you going?
I need darkness.
She needs darkness for what?
(SIGHS) To see.
(CHUCKLES)
[Hild] Leofric, where are we?
[Leofric] We are at the marshlands of the Severn, the swamplands.
I have never seen lands like this before.
 Hurry. They've seen us!
The boats won't wait.
Priests.
 We need to leave.
 Hurry.
In fear.
[Hild] God preserve us.
(SOLDIERS SHOUTING)
Time to fight, Arseling.
(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)
(SCREAMS)
Uhtred!
(SHOUTING)
Arseling...
I have your sword.
(SOLDIERS SHOUT INDISTINCTLY)
We'll get you!
(ALL PANTING)
I hope you are carrying silver, priest.
We've saved your life.
I'm saved by ghosts it seems.
Lord.
Thank God, you're unhurt.
I was blessed.
And your family?
Are safe.
They are in the boat ahead.
Hoping to find sanctuary in these marshlands.
At the palace, Lord. They came from nowhere.
They did.
They came because they were allowed to.
Where were your watchers?
Your spies?
On their knees, no doubt.
You should show respect.
Wessex allows its warriors to kill each other and spends too much time on its knees.
Too much money on its churches.
If Guthrum were Christian and not Pagan, there would be no war.
But, he's not.
You will do well to remember that I am King.
King of what?
Look around you.
He's our King.
Like every kingdom before it, Wessex has fallen.
He is Alfred...
A man.
King of nothing.
(SIGHS)
(BABY CRYING)
(BABY COUGHS)
Lord God, allow your blessed oils to penetrate and take away any and all fever and sickness.
Restore health and strength to the child and to his ever watchful parents.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
(AELSWITH SHUSHING)
(BABY COUGHS)
(BABY CONTINUES CRYING)
(SHUSHING)
Lord, I have prepared a tonic.
For the pain.
For the pain you suffer here.
You pass blood? From your arse?
It's nothing more than what grows from the earth, Lord.
Drink it.
Is it good?
Oh, not at all.
Thank you.
There will be more tomorrow.
He will become lost.
I guarantee it.
Were you worried that I would lose my way?
One path looks like another.
You have explored?
A little.
What do you notice about this place?
It's wet.
There are no horizons.
No sense of something beyond.
My priests have visited here once or twice to preach.
The people are oblivious to God.
My wife would like us to take a ship to Frankia.
To become another king in exile?
So, you admit I am still a king?
We dare not travel.
My son would never survive it.
You should send out word that you are alive.
Asking men to join you, to follow you.
And then what? Fight?
Is that what you would do?
It's what a king would do.
I have given it thought, of course I have.
And this much I know.
If I am to fight, it would have to be a single battle, and soon before yet more Danes arrive.
Before Wessex crumbles skirmish by skirmish, raid by raid, piece by piece.
Therefore...
Your first task would be to...
Somehow...
Convince the Danes to hold one great and deciding moment.
A single defining battle?
Yes.
Who should I send out into the country with the news I'm here?
It would have to be your priests, all of them.
Each in a separate direction.
Their prayers are needed here.
Your son grows weaker despite their prayers.
For that I'm sorry.
Every breath is an effort for him. (SOBS)
I don't know whether to make him warm or keep him cool.
(BABY WAILING)
(SHUSHING)
Well, we will...
We will remain here until he is well.
(BABY CRYING)
(BABY COUGHS)
Father.
Shh.
(BABY COUGHING IN DISTANCE)
[Uhtred] Will the child die?
Can you save him?
There is a way.
Though, it is not a good way.
If it is the only way, then you must.
You are feeling a little better, Lord?
I am.
Iseult is a healer.
She could help your son.
Thank you.
If you help, then you better succeed.
If the child dies, you'll be blamed.
We cannot do nothing.
That is not what I'm saying.
Iseult is a Pagan and a woman.
She will be blamed, regardless of her meaning well.
If it's true that Alfred is in the swampland, how long do we wait for him to come out?
If he is hiding in the swampland, we would be fools to go searching.
Have you seen anything like this?
The monasteries keep words like this.
No, no, no. Not like this.
What does it all mean?
What does all this speak of?
I cannot say I care.
Whatever Alfred found out about his enemies, he'd write.
Yeah.
It's magic.
(CHUCKLES)
Yeah, it is.
(LAUGHS)
You are laughing.
It's a weak kind of magic.
No, no, no, you're wrong.
This is...
It is words without sound.
This is voices without people.
I am going to learn how to use this magic.
And if we took Alfred, he could teach you.
Only a fool would march an army into a swampland.
Are you that fool?
Are you that fool?
Ragnar?
No, I'm not.
Then we wait.
We need to be closer.
(SOFT THUD)
[Leofric] Uhtred.
The water is rising.
Lord, you had one task.
Oh, no. I am sorry.
(ISEULT CLEARS THROAT)
Well, I have never cooked before and never again, I fear.
Are they burned?
[Leofric] They are done well, Lord.
A challenge for your teeth and stomach.
I have seen a fleet on the Severn.
They carry Skorpa's colours.
How many ships?
Twenty or more.
[Alfred] That's over 1,000 men.
Guthrum will have the same.
More.
God save us.
We can save ourselves.
We must believe it.
(BABY COUGHING)
(SHUSHING)
Will the lady be joining us, Lord?
Um, no, she will not.
She is angry with me still for sending away the priests.
[Uhtred] Sending out the priests was the right thing, Lord.
Let us pray you are correct.
If you will excuse me.
If the child dies, it will take the fight from Alfred's bones.
And we will never save ourselves.
Aelswith.
You must end this silence.
The priests will fetch men.
Without men, safe passage to the south into Frankia would be impossible.
At best our children would be taken as slaves.
(CHILD WHEEZING)
You are eating meat.
Why?
These last few days the pains have abated.
Meat does not agree.
I could not cope with further sickness.
In the mind of Brother Asser, she is a witch.
And yet you gladly drink her potion.
It is a tonic.
I can read you.
You wish to put our child in the hands of the devil.
Our prayers are not being answered.
Is it any wonder, we find ourselves living in a muddy puddle?
(BABY COUGHS)
Father, please. Come, warm yourself by the fire.
I bring word. From the king.
He lives.
Wessex lives and breathes, Wulfhere.
Thank God.
[Aelswith] Oh, my goodness.
She has the nerve to approach.
She has helped me.
(BABY CRYING)
Thank you.
I, for one, do not wish to hear your voice.
Do not speak a word.
Is there something you wish to say, Iseult?
(BABY COUGHING)
If you wish, Lord, I will try and help your child.
We do not wish.
Tonight is a good night.
We do not wish.
Tomorrow, it will be too late.
What kind of talk is that?
(SOBBING) What kind of talk is "too late"?
Are you saying that my child will die?
[Alfred] Aelswith, Aelswith, please.
Get her away from me. Get her away from me.
Get her out of my sight!
Please, stop.
Get her out of my sight!
Lord?
She's offering help.
My priest told me that you are a witch.
And they are correct.
She's no witch!
Aelswith, please, no more.
No more, no more.
You are upsetting yourself.
You are upsetting the children. No more.
(BABY CRYING)
(WHISPERS) Come here.
No, no, no, no, no. Please! No, no!
Go, go, please.
Iseult, you must prepare.
(SHUSHING)
[Uhtred] Lord?
It can only be tonight.
She'll be ready.
(BABY CONTINUES CRYING)
(SHUSHING)
The child will pass from one chamber to the other.
From near death to life.
(SIGHS)
What is it?
If this child is to live, then another, somewhere, must die.
I will be taking a life.
A stranger, an innocent.
Iseult.
This must be done.
Lady Aelswith.
Leave me.
I cannot.
You need comfort.
When a child suffers, the mother suffers.
I know this.
I know the pain you feel.
It's almost unbearable.
Even for a queen.
He's dying.
(SOBBING)
She is a Pagan.
And yet she has helped the king.
I am to trust a stranger with my child?
There is good in Iseult.
(BABY GURGLING)
I don't know what is worse.
When he cries, or when he's still.
When he's still, I feel the need to prod him awake.
It is retribution. God is punishing me.
For what?
For Aethelwold, for taking his crown.
Aethelwold is a fool. He could never be king.
Your God is testing you.
Lord, give Edward to Iseult.
If God will not cure Edward, what makes you think that he would allow a Pagan to succeed?
(SIGHS)
Who is to say that God is not working through us all?
Did he not make the Pagans, too?
Beocca would tell me that...
God's ways are known only to himself.
You have been brought to the marshes for a reason.
You have this one chance to save your son.
And you will have one chance to save your kingdom.
The two are bound together.
Edward is your heir.
If he lives, I would say it's a sign.
Wessex will live.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
There is barely a heartbeat.
Let me give the child to Iseult.
(SNIFFLES)
Oh, may God have mercy on each of us.
Where is he taking him?
Am I allowed to know?
To Iseult.
God is watching.
[Beocca] (VOICE ECHOES) Lord?
(NORMAL VOICE) Lord?
Good morning, Lord.
We received your message. We came as quickly as we could.
Father Beocca, is that you?
Yes, Lord.
You are here?
I am, Lord.
And you brought men.
Wulfhere.
Lord.
Well, how warming it is to see you all.
It's good to see you again, Lord.
And many more are nearby. Guards, men.
Even the Brother Asser is here.
We've all been saying prayers for your health and safety.
Praying, yes.
[Beocca] And for Edward, of course.
Every priest in the land has been instructed to hold service for his recovery.
For Edward, I am blessed.
[Beocca] How is the boy, Lord?
Edward.
Lord?
What is it, Lord?
(PANTING)
Oh, please. Oh, please. God, no.
Say he has not been taken from me.
No, Lord, this is not his grave.
(BABY COOING)
He is well, Lord.
What?
And he is healed.
Healed?
Lord, what is this?
It's good news, Father.
Rejoice.
[Alfred] He is well.
(LAUGHS)
Oh...
(LAUGHS)
He is well. It is true, he is...
He is well. He is cool.
He is well, Beocca.
I can... I can feel his heart beating strongly.
God has not forsaken you, Lord.
Fetch Aelswith! Fetch his mother.
The prayers of the whole of Wessex have been answered.
Indeed.
Every mass, Lord, every mass said by 100 priests or more has been heard.
Look at him. Look at him, he is well.
God is good, praise him!
Yes, praise him, Father Beocca.
You did well.
Why the tears?
They are for the stranger's child.
(SOBBING)
[Leofric] You are wet, Arseling.
(PANTING) I am.
Wet, tired, but I have a plan.
Lord, the ships are guarded by no more than 60 men.
The rest of the army will be inland, looking for food.
We kill the men, we burn the ships.
You really believe Skorpa will then go to Guthrum?
I do.
One army, one battle. It's the only way, Lord.
It begins here, in these waters.
You were brought here for this reason, Lord.
They need to give chase and they need to believe they can reach us.
We stand our ground until the very last moment.
Then we stay on the safe path.
And let the land half kill them before we attack.
And if they do reach us?
Ready?
[Uhtred] Remember, don't kill them.
Just make them mad.
Another.
Are you wishing to die?
Another.
Who are you, you piece of weasel shit?
You want me to spill your guts?
Hera I am, I'm waiting!
We'll send each of you to corpse hall.
hit the big bastard.
Come and fight! Or are you afraid?
[man] My axes!
(SCREAMS)
(ALL SCREAM)
We stand our ground.
We stand our ground.
Run! Run, run, run!
(PANTING)
(GROWLING)
(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)
(GROANING)
(MEN GROANING)
Now, for the ships! (PANTING)
A new horizon, Lord.
[Alfred] A beacon of hope.
God has tested you, Lord.
He's put you into the fire as a smith would his steel.
And like the steel you have emerged stronger.
Praise him.
Praise him, Lord.
You're right, Beocca.
God works in the strangest of ways, known only to himself.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SEASON: 01
EPISODE: 06
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
My name is Uhtred, son of Uhtred... born a Saxon, but raised as a Dane. I now serve King Alfred of Wessex. I have married a pious wife for Alfred. I have taken on land burdened with debt and cheating workers. And I killed the mighty sword Dane, Ubba.
But with Odda the elder wounded in battle... his son took the credit for my kill. The truth was ignored...
I fought Ubba man-on-man and I killed him!
And I was forced to my knees before Alfred's God.
I will lead, but you owe me.
You must lay flat. Kiss the cross.
Kiss my arse.
Fate is testing me, but I will survive.
Uhtred!
Destiny is all.
[Leofric] You certain you want to do this, arseling?
Is there a law against it?
Dressing up as Danes... no.
Plundering Cornwalum... yes.
We're supposed to be at peace.
If I'm to reclaim Bebbanburg, I'll need an army.
If I'm ever to raise an army, I'll need silver.
We go.
I have no quarrel.
Will Odda not miss you?
I'm doing as he asks... I'm watching you.
He's building Alfred a church at Cynuit.
Have you heard?
With an altar of gold, they say.
Who are they?
They belong to Oswald.
Their mother sends them, hoping to shame me for killing their lying, thieving father.
I see her plan is working.
They're not the first to lose a parent.
They'll live.
The food is good, Mildrith.
Thank you.
I'm pleased you like it.
I was beginning to believe you'd lost your tongue, wife.
I was worried.
I doubt it.
She grieves for the thief.
Not my business.
He kills a man I have known all my life, he refuses to pay Wergild to a family I have known all my life, and the village my father helped build now call him Uhtred the godless.
Not forgetting I refused to have my son baptized a Christian.
I'll excuse myself.
Leofric sit, please.
None of this is my business.
I'll stop.
Tomorrow I'll be gone.
Gone?
Should anyone ask, we're keeping Alfred's kingdom safe... again.
For how long will you be gone?
And gone where?
No idea how long.
Weeks.
Your place is here.
Oswald's wife has gone to bishop Alewold.
The bishop will go to Alfred and Alfred will send men to our door...
I won't pay a penny, and if men do come calling, that's what you'll tell them.
He was killed because he was a thief, that's my law!
Leave me and I'll go directly to the church and have our son blessed.
Then he won't be my son.
May God forgive you for saying such a thing.
Which God?
What has happened to you?
What has happened to the kindness and perhaps even the love you have once shown me.
I was made to crawl!
Yes! Before God!
We all fall to our knees before God!
I won't forget what Alfred did to me in the name of his God!
I reject that God!
I will excuse myself.
Are you there still... the man I cared for?
Are you there still, the woman I ached to plough?
[Odda] Progress is being made daily, Lord.
You must come to Cynuit and inspect the building work.
Oh, I will, I will. I would like that.
It's impressive enough, even now.
Yes.
We have the nave here.
Mm-hmm.
The transept's thus, and then into the chancel.
With its already famous altar of solid gold.
It will be gilding, no more, Lord, but you know how tongues wag.
Mm. With your permission, I would like to place the altar just here.
Why would you need my permission?
It's on the exact spot where Ubba Lothbrokson is now buried.
You wish God's altar to be built over the buried remains of a pagan?
Oh, no. No, Lord.
With your permission, we will exhume the remains and, I don't know, have them thrown into the river.
You will exhume the remains and have them buried elsewhere... unmarked, but with respect.
'Twas a joke, Lord, a poor joke.
We must do nothing to endanger the peace.
With respect, Lord, I am not the fool my father...
...at times, made me out to be.
Father Beocca, you wish to see me?
Ah, a letter, Lord, from the bishop Alewold.
Private or business?
A matter of law, I was told.
Then read it.
Well, can you not read the writing, Beocca?
It concerns the ealdorman Uhtred.
He has slain a farm worker and is refusing to pay the monies owed to the family... the Wergild.
Would you like me to investigate further, Lord?
No. No, 'tis not your place.
Odda, you shall investigate the rights and wrongs of the matter on my behalf.
I only hope for the sake of Uhtred's wife, the killing was justified.
Uhtred has always been fair-minded.
I'm sure there are mitigations.
Mm, we shall see.
In the meantime, Odda, do your best.
Keep the peace.
Yes, Lord.
[Uhtred] I'll find the wealth to pay off the debt.
We want the same thing... the land of our birth.
Yours won't be taken from you.
Mine?
Are you no longer the ealdorman?
I'll never be accepted as an ealdorman... not here.
Then I beg you for one last time... change your ways, Uhtred.
If you allow God into your heart, he will guide you.
I can never become the man you want me to be.
You could try.
I would despise that man.
[Leofric] Arseling!
I have loved you.
Don't pray for me.
Did you hump her goodbye, arseling?
I want to have left Wessex by tonight.
You're gonna have to ride faster than that, arseling.
Come on! Yah! Aah!
 
No one is to wear these till we have crossed into Cornwalum.
What you can do is Polish them.
So that when we do wear them, they'll be seen clearly... and you'll be feared.
You're going to find out what it's like to be a Dane.
Every man stand where he is.
No one move. You!
Stay where you are.
Do I know you?
Lower your hood.
I said lower your hood!
Aethelwold.
I...I-I merely want to come with you... to be part of your adventure.
I wanted it to be a surprise.
He cannot be here. He cannot hold his tongue.
I say we kill him.
You can't kill me. I'm the rightful King, you fool.
Not here. Leofric, not in Wessex!
Then I will drag him into Cornwalum!
Not now!
No, you can't! Uhtred, you owe me a favor.
I call it in now.
If Alfred hears of Christians raiding Cornwalum, we will all be killed!
He guarantees that outcome!
Leofric, I am a changed man.
I swear!
We kill him.
He will not be missed.
We take him with us.
I owe him.
He's my responsibility.
He has my protection.
And who will protect the rest of us?
I've never seen him so angry.
You will clean our mail and tend to the horses.
Anything.
You'll wipe our arses if I say so.
Of course.
I'm gathering the moss and dock leaves as you speak, Lord.
 
What do you know of Cornwalum?
That it's not Wessex.
The Wessex-Cornwalum border is this river... the Tamar river.
Which is why we are camped here.
It flows north to south, and Cornwalum itself has a coastline shaped like a leg.
So they are traders?
Yes, on the north coast to the welsh kingdoms and Ireland, and on the south to the Franks.
How do you know this?
I'm an educated man, Leofric.
I simply enjoy hiding the fact.
You do it well.
Do they have a King?
More than one.
Fierce fighters?
Have no fear, Leofric, we are Danes.
I want to be blooded... in battle.
 Don't worry, boy, you'll be first in line.
I look forward to it.
Good day, Lord.
Tell your master ealdorman Odda is here with God's bishop Alewold.
Yes, Lord.
Quickly.
It's not the most desirable farmstead I've seen.
Ealdorman Odda, bishop Alewold... a pleasant surprise.
May I offer a refreshment?
We are here on the King's business.
'Tis with your husband.
Is he here?
He is not.
Can he be fetched, my dear?
All crucifixes and crosses.
You are God-fearing Christians no more.
You don't cross yourself nor look to the heavens.
Let's make ourselves rich!
[Mildrith] My husband is protecting our kingdom.
From whom? We're at peace.
He only said he was doing Alfred's work.
He doesn't trust the Danes.
He thinks he knows better than the King.
Your own man, Leofric, will give you detail, I'm sure.
Yes.
[Alewold] Odda, it's not the child's fault that she was married off to a tyrant and a fool.
No.
Of course not.
Mildrith, it is with great reluctance that I must serve you with this letter... for your husband upon his return.
He must settle the Wergild for Oswald's death or face confiscation of his property.
Which is also my property.
If you're ever in need, my father's house will always be your house.
How is Lord Odda faring? Well, I hope.
Frail.
He's still very frail.
The blow would have killed many a man.
Take consolation, lady, that should your land be confiscated, it is the church that'll benefit.
Aah!
No, no, no! Please, get off me!
Where's it buried? Where's the silver?
Where is it?
These people have nothing.
Please!
Five days and nothing.
There is time yet.
We're not the first Danes they've seen.
I need silver.
So we keep looking.
And what if the whole of Cornwalum's been sacked already?
We keep looking.
We keep heading west.
 
Do they want to speak?
Five men to match theirs.
And only I speak.
Aethelwold?
I heard.
Only the great Uhtred speaks.
I am brother Asser.
I bring you a gift from my King.
From King Peredur.
Never heard of him.
I assure you my King has heard of you.
A troop of Danes raiding villages in Cornwalum does not go unnoticed.
Why does your Peredur send me these miserable offerings?
A gesture of peace... a token.
Our King has been attacked by a fellow Briton and neighbor...
Callyn... whose forces have seized the fort guarding our land.
I am sent to tell you Peredur will pay you well to help him recapture this fort.
Pay us well?
How much?
I do not know the sum, but I am sure he will be generous.
He has silver?
He is a King.
 
Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup!
Winchester, it is not.
Alfred, he is not.
The King greets you.
He does?
I hear nothing.
You are pagans.
The King is Christian and will only speak with you through me.
If you would come forward and pay your respects...
Please inform the King Danes don't bow to Christians.
This fort you want us to recapture... it's defended by how many Britons?
And what price will you pay?
It would be much simpler if the King addressed me directly.
Easy... they have between 40 and 50 men.
No more than 50.
We are 30... fighting men.
And we are 20.
How much in silver?
100 pieces of silver.
I won't bargain. I'll tell you the price.
400 pieces of silver.
That is an absurd sum.
Is Peredur a King or not?
I will call for queen Iseult.
Lord, perhaps, instead, you should take a moment and pray for guidance.
Iseult!
You are needed!
I am blessed with two wives... two queens.
Iseult is a shadow queen.
You know what I require of you. Of course you do.
Who are you... and what will you do for the King?
I am Uhtred Ragnarson.
I'm here to fight for your King... if he pays me what I'm worth.
He is the one.
You are fortunate to have such a wife.
She's not to hump.
She's too valuable.
400...  pieces of silver...
Agreed.
I'll see it?
You'll see it once the fort is taken.
No, I'll see it now.
All of my wealth is hidden within the fort.
Then your enemy has it.
Well hidden.
You have your price. You have my terms.
I know you'll accept.
I know you can smell the silver.
Danes, mm?
You have a nose for blood and silver... and women.
And so I will add to the price, my queen... this queen.
If we win back the fort and you're lying about the silver, I'll kill u.
Which is why I do not lie!
Call the men up. We stay here.
I'll dream about that shadow queen.
You told her your name, and word travels.
[Asser] Uhtred Ragnarson!
I noticed that you have some Saxons amongst your ranks.
Some from Mercia.
They'd rather fight than work in the fields.
The pay is better.
He would like to attack at the earliest opportunity... does not wish to feed you for more than one night.
How Christian of him.
He would like to be a man of God, but, as you have witnessed, he cannot let go of his pagan ways.
The queen Iseult.
Mm, she's a gwrach. A sorceress.
What are her powers?
Peredur believes she can see into the future... for as long as she remains a virgin.
Tell the King to have his men ready.
 
Peredur, any in the fort who try to escape are yours, yes?
You will do your part, Dane. I will do mine.
Walk on! Advance!
[Leofric] Let's scare the shit out of the bastard Britons... see if they have the stomach for this.
Hold.
We hold here.
Why would they leave a fortress to face us?
Aethelwold, advance.
Go on the Ridge and see why they are prepared to leave the fortress.
On my own?
You wanted to be first in line.
Yah.
What do you see?!
They are Danes!
Real Danes!
 
Stand still! Hold!
[Peredur] What are you waiting for?
[Uhtred] They're Danes!
What do you care?
You people will fight anyone for money... even yourselves!
You lied to me.
Think of the silver!
The queen has seen your victory, so fight!
Uhtred.
He's a sword-Dane... a Lord of war.
[Aethelwold] If the Lord of war wants to talk, may I suggest we listen?
Name yourself.
I am Uhtred Ragnarson.
Who are you?
Skorpa... of the white horse.
You are the Uhtred Ragnarson who was at Cynuit?
I am.
The Saxon son of Earl Ragnar.
Yes.
You will not defeat me. You know this.
Perhaps not, but I could kill half your men trying.
Yes.
Yes, you could.
Then it would be best for us both if you did not try.
Lord.
Lord, I fear what will happen if they're allowed to speak.
Then go to them. Listen to what they're saying.
My presence, Lord, will serve only to antagonize the Dane.
Uhtred Ragnarson! What is happening here?!
They must leave my kingdom or die!
Bastard Danes.
The queen saw victory.
I pray, Lord.
What is your battle price?
[Uhtred] Silver... and he says it's hidden in the fortress.
No.
No, we have ripped the fortress apart.
We found nothing.
He must have something... somewhere.
[Peredur] Uhtred Ragnarson!
Whatever he has, I say we split.
Half and half.
We kill his men, we spare the King, he takes us to his wealth.
Half and half?
I will advance, you will turn, and we will attack together.
Now, this is for the benefit of the King.
You bastard piece of rassragr!
I'll destroy you!
Be ready. We kill them all!
Every last one of them dies!
Tell the men we're with the Danes.
 
At the ready!
You trust this Skorpa?
We have no choice but to trust him.
Now! Turn!
To the death!
You bastard Danes!
You'll cry for your stinking whore mothers!
Aaaaah!
Aaaaah!
You lying, thieving, bastard Danes!
I could kill at least one more of you! Aah!
T... 
It is over.
Your wealth.
My wealth for my life, is it?
Your wealth and your shadow queen.
 Useless bitch.
She saw victory.
Where's the silver?
If I tell you, you'll kill me, and I would rather you remain poor.
You have my word as a warlord... you will be spared.
Where is the silver?
Speak or you will die.
It is buried... in the hall... beneath my throne.
I need a small amount mys...
Do we split her, too?
You have the tits, I'll have the arse.
She's mine.
You are here for the silver.
It is beneath this seat.
I have a question.
Have you been waiting for us?
For you.
Then you saw what would happen?
I knew that you would come.
That is all.
Uhtred, what do you know of a church with a golden altar?
At Cynuit... to celebrate the killing of Ubba.
I hear they're building a church.
Who's been telling you this?
Men... begging to live.
Would say anything.
And that's where you'll go... to Cynuit?
Well, I have ships to repair.
The coastline here has been murder.
How do we do this?
How do we share?
We don't... share.
Oh, we can fight... and some of us will die, including your queen.
 
Uhtred Ragnarson, keep your sword in its scabbard.
Wise queen.
She stays with me.
She stays with me!
Do nothing!
Uhtred, no! Uhtred!
[Uhtred] They have our treasure!
No! I will not fight these Danes for silver.
For King, yes, but not for silver.
I am tethered by debts, I need to raise an army, and they get away further with every second.
I will not allow half these men or more to die.
[Iseult] I can give you what you need.
There's more... silver.
What did he whisper?
Skorpa, when he was leaving.
I will tell you when I believe you need to know.
How was I... as a warrior?
Aethelwold, you're as much a warrior as you are a King.
This isn't part of the plunder.
It's a holy cross. It goes back to the church.
There'll be blessings.
But the rest...  it's all ours.
[Leofric] Home?
Wessex... and our separate ways. There's a bishop I must see.
 
[Iseult] I've never seen a village like this before.
[Uhtred] We will be here for just the day.
Who are you?
I'll speak with the bishop Alewold.
Bishop Alewold is at prayer.
He'll see me.
He is at prayer and won't be disturbed.
Alewold! Bishop Alewold.
What is this? Get out! Out!
We-we-we're busy with our work.
So I see.
I said get out!
I know you.
Uhtred.
The godless... yes.
And my wife, through her father, has inherited a debt to the church.
Oh, yes... a substantial debt, I recall.
Which I would now discharge.
You would? Very well.
As you see, we're busy with...
That's Irish work.
It looks Irish, and its weight.
A thing of beauty and of great value.
It seemed a fitting way of settling the debt... if you'll accept. Of course, if not, I'll put it in the Smith's fire.
I accept on behalf of the church.
I accept.
I trust I can rely upon your good judgment in dismissing the matter of my servant Oswald's Wergild.
He was a thief.
Consider all matters resolved.
Bless you.
 
I've been praying daily for your safe return.
Who's this?
She's a queen.
Queen of where? Of whom?
Britons.
Uhtred, you walked by your son without a look.
Is he baptized now?
Yes.
Against my wishes.
I have done nothing that requires forgiveness.
What's her name?
I am called Iseult.
I'm speaking with my husband.
You can kindly remain silent.
Mildrith, we are hungry, thirsty, and in need of rest.
 I am not your servant!
Do not speak to me as if I were!
I am your wife!
You are no longer a part of Uhtred's path.
It is true.
Out.
Out!
This "queen" can sleep with the animals!
You should know that your land is safe.
I have seen bishop Alewold. The debt's settled... all of it.
That's what I've come to tell you.
Nothing more.
And what of Oswald's Wergild?
That, too, is settled.
His family won't receive a penny.
Then you can explain that to the King's council.
Alfred has called you to the Witan.
It's finished.
Everything.
Before I left, I said that I've loved you... and it's true.
You will not speak of us in this way... and in the presence of a pagan whore!
She's with me.
Will you be resting with your family or with the animals?
You chose the company of pigs and a goat over your wife and son?
My wife's a good woman.
She loves her God and it's hard for her to be with the like of me.
And if the marriage is to be ended, I must become used to life without my son.
I'm here because I choose you.
Though I won't keep you against your will.
What?
I will be with you, Uhtred, from now until the very end.
That is what I see.
I want you to see my home... my land in the north.
It is this Alfred who directs you, for now.
You must give in to fate.
Attend his Witan.
Will you sleep alongside me tonight, under the furs?
Sleep?
Nothing more.
I would like that... as the only other source of warmth would be a goat.
Edwina.
Lady?
Please inform your family that I will be travelling... with the child.
We will leave for Lord Odda's estate.
I would like you with me, but it is your decision.
I know how important it is to be amongst the people who care for you.
I would not wish to leave you.
The very day I am told that my home is my own... is the day I decide I must leave.
 
Oh Lord, grant wisdom to your servants gathered here.
Help them to decide what is right, what is just, and what is fair.
Grant us this, oh, Lord.
 Grant us, oh, Lord.
[man] Leave your sword.
Uhtred.
Uhtred!
Beocca.
Quickly. You're late.
You were sent for days ago.
You should have been here on time.
Since when has my presence been so important?
Who is she?
She's with me.
Is she part of your plunder?
What's been said?
You will hear it all soon enough.
Now, we must go, and you must be respectful... now more than ever.
And as local Thegns skimp in their duty to repair the Bridges, I wish to ask of the King to appoint an official to survey the kingdom's roads.
The bridge on the road...
What reason do I have to beg for mercy?
What's been said?
Quiet now.
Is it Cornwalum?
Respect.
...remains disinterested.
We shall talk of Bridges later.
Beocca, what is this?
You will be quiet, there!
Face your King!
Come.
There is a, um, an urgent matter, which, with the Witan's permission, we shall deal with now.
Ealdorman Uhtred... also known in your parish as Uhtred the godless...
You are on this day charged with taking a troop of the King's men into Cornwalum and there making war against the Britons without your King's consent.
You are also charged with joining forces with the Dane called skorpa, to murder Christian-folk in Cornwalum, despite these folk all living in peace with Alfred and with Wessex.
All this is proven with oaths, and the punishment for these crimes is death.
Who swears these oaths?
We shall get to that.
Show me.
Who swears?
I, brother Asser, swear these oaths.
Uhtred, to your knees.
Never.
Lord, we were patrolling your borders and protecting your kingdom, nothing more.
There is more to my story, Lord, if I may.
Now is the time to beg.
Yes, let him speak.
Let's hear his story.
On my way to make this complaint to King Alfred, I came via Cynuit... and such a sight I hope never to see again.
For, where the church to commemorate Lord Odda's victory over Ubba was to be built, I saw devastation, destruction, and the charred remains of 15 monks or more.
Men have told me that this evil was the work of the very same skorpa who was in Cornwalum, and that with him, once more, was the ealdorman Uhtred.
This man!
No! No, these are lies. Lord, Lord,  He lies with every breath.
Lord, hear me. Let me speak, and hear the truth.
We are the Witan... and we shall behave in the way of a Witan.
The ealdorman is entitled to respond!
Yes, I was at Cynuit. I was at Cynuit once... and once only.
I was at Cynuit on the day that I, Uhtred of Bebbanburg, killed Ubba.
I look around this hall and into the eyes of the warriors who know this to be true... and that is the only occasion I was at Cynuit.
We are here... we are here to deliver judgment on the murder of King Peredur and the Christian Britons of Cornwalum.
Then if I can speak of Cornwalum, Lord.
There is a further witness, I believe.
What if Peredur's queen was to stand in front of this Witan and tell you that Peredur lied and cheated us?
She is a shadow queen and a pagan, Lord.
Her words would be meaningless.
Is the truth not important, Lord?
Lord!
Odda, we shall move on.
There is a further witness.
Yes, Lord.
Bring in the prisoner.
What is this?
Odda means for you to die as a traitor, and you will die.
If it is Valhalla you want, I will do my best to give it.
I said you will stand separate.
Leofric, you have sworn your oath, and you will tell the truth.
I will, Lord.
God is merciful.
You're a man of Wessex and have been loyal to the King?
I am loyal to the King, Lord. Always.
Were you in Cornwalum with the ealdorman Uhtred?
I was.
Did you kill and plunder Peredur and his Britons?
I did.
Leofric, have you now donated your share of the plunder to the church?
I have, Lord, and have begged forgiveness.
The Witan hears you, Leofric.
Whom did you follow into battle?
I went willingly, Lord.
No, Uhtred led, you followed.
He is the ealdorman, and he is to blame!
I share the blame, Lord.
No, he is responsible!
Irresponsible.
And he will pay for it with his life!
For the last time, beg.
No, I will not beg!
I will fall to my knees for no man, no King, and no Christian God!
Yeah.
He must pay with his life.
Lord, if I may make a plea to the King and the Witan.
I have not yet finished.
I beg your pardon, Lord, but if I may.
It is clear that, like me, the arseling here is guilty.
Thank you, my friend. 
Because of my own guilt, and because of my respect for Uhtred as a warrior, I request that he dies at my sword.
You wish to become executioner, Leofric?
My plea is for a fight to the death, Lord... me against the arseling.
If God is with me, I will be the Victor and the ealdorman is allowed to die as a warrior should.
And if he should win this fight to the death, what then?
He will not.
It would take God's intervention for him to beat me.
Let them fight, Lord.
Let God decide.
Leofric, you have spoken well, and your request is granted.
You will fight tomorrow... to the death... swords and shields.
God shall determine the Victor.
 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SEASON: 01
EPISODE: 05
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[Uhtred] My name is Uhtred, son of Uhtred. I was born a Saxon, but stolen and raised as a Dane. Now I find myself bound to King Alfred and bound by marriage to Wessex. I have a Christian wife, whom I care for...  ...And a child I have never seen. I have land burdened with debt...
It is a substantial amount, Lord.
Alfred could remove the debt, but he has chosen not to.
.. and a sly servant I cannot trust. And though I miss the ways of the Danes and their hunger for life and for battle...
Never cross Ubba, and never, never fight him.
.. fate has stirred my Saxon heart for a reason.
Horse[man] Ubba and his army have returned from Ireland.
And my fleet is where?
They left Lundene several days ago and are nearly here, Lord.
Destiny is all.
Lord! Lord! When will you need assistance?!
Mildrith!
Odda?
Mildrith, thank God.
What are you doing here?
You must come with me.
The peace is over. We are under siege.
Since when?
You must gather all you need and quickly.
The Danes could be here at any time.
I cannot go with you.
Yes, you can. You must.
If the peace is over, then what of Uhtred?
Mildrith, the Danes have broken the truce.
We have killed all the hostages given to us, and they will have done the same.
If Uhtred has survived, it can only be as a traitor, a Dane. No.
Regardless, it is no longer safe for you here.
You must come with me.
Mildrith, I beg you, for the sake of your child.
Do not worry about us, lady!
We'll get ourselves and the livestock to the hills!
Get yourself clear of this place!
Anything of value, I will bury!
 
[man] Don't just pull at the bugger. You'll have it torn.
Find out what holds it.
[Uhtred] How much for your horse?
He's not for sale.
I'll give you twice its worth.
In silver.
Have any washed up alive?
Not on my beach.
God's taken hundreds of the bastards.
Though it's said hundreds more have landed safely further up the shore.
Friends of yours?
[Uhtred] You should take your families to safety.
Ertwit.
He has your look... definitely.
Little ertwit. Little ertwit.
Well, let's hope he does not develop my constitution, hmm?
They are here.
Shh, shh, shh, shh. 
Odda? Wulfhere?
Lord. Lord.
Difficult times, which we will face head-on.
They never rest.
Do we march as one, Lord, or are we to split?
We are split.
You both shall ride towards the Severn river to face Ubba.
I shall ride south to face Guthrum.
Should we not all be marching to the Severn, Lord?
If the first battle is won, then the Danes may not care for a second.
Wulfhere, even in victory, we can never be sure of our surviving numbers.
Some of Guthrum's ships will have made it to shore, and I cannot let him simply walk through Wessex.
He must be faced.
Odda, should either of us have luck and defeat our enemy quickly, we will march to the other's aid.
Yes, Lord. Of course.
Prepare.
 
My God, girl. You're a lovely field to plough.
A lovely field to plough.
Oh, better than barley.
Better than barley. 
By God, girl! Better than barley!
Yeah!
Yeah! Better than barley!
 Lord!
Lord! Forgive me, Lord.
It's never happened before.
I swear it'll never happen again.
It was the girl's idea.
It was not.
[Uhtred] Where's my wife?
It was not my idea at... where is my wife and child?
Lord, wait. Wait, Lord!
She's with Lord Odda, the younger.
Odda?
Yes, Lord.
He took the lady and your son.
She went willingly, Lord, to protect the child.
My son?
Yes, Lord. You have a son.
Handsome little man he is.
Looks like his father.
I should really take your balls for this desecration.
Yes, lor... no, Lord, please.
I don't care for you, your wife, your children, nor your whore.
Lord, he made me do it with the promise of a coin.
It was false promise, Lord. I have no coin.
I'll need a fresh horse, food, and drink.
Yes, Lord. Your horse was returned.
It's in the stab.
My house is not your house.
No, Lord. Beg your pardon, Lord.
My land is not your land.
Treat me as a fool again, and I'll kill you.
Yes, Lord.
I'll enjoy it.
I believe you would.
Leave me.
 
We outnumber them, I feel.
[Leofric] We outnumber them if you count the farm boys and women, Lord.
You fear them, Leofric?
I do not, though some do.
It is not about fear. It's about strategy.
We hold the high ground. They must come to us.
And if they decide to wait, Lord?
Why would they?
Because we are sat isolated on this high ground.
[Wulfhere] And supplies are low.
They don't know that!
We bide our time, hold our position.
With luck, Alfred will see off Guthrum and provide us with reinforcements.
For now, we stay put.
 
Lord.
They are gathering, and they are watching.
They have the high ground, but I do not want to wait.
So when do I attack?
I'll cast the runes.
Storri, I will need a clear answer.
I will get one.
 
I have your answer, Lord.
Look.
This is us at the base of their hill.
They sit on top.
But that's not an advantage.
This is a feather from their camp.
Bone dry and faded.
Water runs down the hill, not up.
You have your wish, Lord.
An early attack is good.
They're weak.
They will surrender or die.
And then we move into the heart of Wessex.
Shield wall!
Advance!
One! Two!
[man] Horseman approaching!
Halt!
Go and fetch Lord Odda.
The elder!
It is Uhtred.
How could he have lived?
We will ask.
Ealderman Uhtred.
We feared you had been killed.
That you were not is a miracle or something less godly.
Where is she?!
What? What?
Where's my wife and child?!
She... she's safe!
You brought her here?
She's safe, did you not hear him?
She's safe.
I took her to safety, nothing more.
Mildrith is with my own wife on my land in my house, where she has lived happily in the past!
Put away your dagger!
Swear that you haven't laid a hand on her.
I will do no such thing.
Swear!
[Leofric] Lord?
You will take your blade away from my Lord, and you will do it now.
Arseling!
You have my word that neither Mildrith nor your son have been harmed.
I swear. Do as I ask.
Treason, but what can we expect?
Enough, this infighting and argument!
Disperse, all of you! Now!
Your wife remains my goddaughter.
You should be thanking my son, not threat him.
Now, you come to me when your thinking is clear, and you explain to me why you are still breathing and stupid!
You are back from the dead and unchanged.
All you had to do was get down from your horse and ask, "have you seen my wife?"
That would have been the better choice, yes.
Then young Odda wouldn't have shit himself.
You've seen her? She's well?
Yes, she's well.
The child, however.
Sickly?
Ugly.
Like his father.
Worse.
With the smallest of pebbles for a penis.
Like his father.
If you wish to see him for yourself, arseling, I say you leave the way you came.
I'm serious.
We are stuck on this hill. And here, we will die.
What does Odda say?
Odda is a decent man, but as a warrior, he has all the guile and menace of a sheep.
[Odda] We have the ground, the slope.
I will not surrender that advantage.
But if food is scarce, Lord, how long can we wait?
We shall find food.
We have food for how many days?
Two, three, four?
Enough time for Alfred to arrive.
You yourself have reported that the storms have taken most of Guthrum's ships.
But not all.
But enough, perhaps.
So we wait, hmm?
Agreed. For a time.
We give Alfred as much time as possible.
I will offer negotiations.
While these negotiations are taking place, we will send out hunting parties... several.
Alfred will come.
I'll attend these negotiations with Ubba.
You have not been invited.
It's my right.
If the other hostages were killed, how did he survive?
He was taken as a child by the Danes, and he survived.
We would do well to follow him.
Follow him?
Or listen to what he has to say, Lord, is what I meant.
 
Lord Ubba.
May I present the Lord Odda of Wessex.
There never seems to be a meeting that you do not attend.
Is there more than one of you?
Lord Ubba is Alfred's most trusted general.
I don't give a shit who he is.
All he needs to do is to surrender.
There will be no surrender.
 What will there be?
There will be no surrender.
Though I do invite you to return to your ships.
Guthrum may have broken the peace, but there's no need for Ubba to do likewise.
We will not be returning to our ships.
And I shall not be moving from this hill.
You have no business in Wessex.
My business is to kill you.
You may try.
Guthrum's fleet is gone.
Njord reached out from the deep and dragged Guthrum's fleet down to the seabed.
You're lying.
I watched the fleet die and its men go under.
Storri, what do you say?
Lord, I do not see for Guthrum.
I see for you.
Storri is a man who has a stick up his ass.
He didn't see that coming, either.
No, that's... that's a lie.
It's all lies. Look at his eyes.
You are next to die, Ubba.
And I know it. I cast the runes.
That's an even bigger lie!
Earl Ragnar the Fearless is with the gods, and they're angry at you.
You allow his death to go unpunished.
Avenging Earl Ragnar is not my business!
That's for his son.
You're next to die, Ubba.
 Then fight me!
And you'll see who is next to die.
Fight me!
Lord, we're negotiating.
You will not say another word.
He will not say another word.
He will not, no. Best not.
I will not say another word.
Talking is over.
You piece of weasel shit.
Storri.
Storri!
What now, huh?
Where are we left standing, in shit?
Now we have time.
How? If it's possible, you've made them want to kill us even more.
We should attack.
 
[Odda] My men are good men.
Though half of them are armed only with reaping hooks, they're here.
Reaping hooks can kill.
How well do you know Ubba?
I've known Ubba since I was 11 years old.
He's the greatest warrior I've ever seen.
But he's cautious.
He listens to the gods always.
I goaded him only to make him doubt.
It will take a little while for the doubt to clear.
You have your time, but I say again, we should attack.
We attack, we'll be outflanked.
My men will die... all of them.
I know each of them.
I'd hoped this hill and Alfred might save them... us.
What if we were able to outflank the Danes?
How?
We burn their ships.
Even if it's just three or four, they'd be running to the fire.
Then we attack.
They'll be disorganized.
No shield wall.
We could be killing them before they know we're there.
Who would set the fires?
I will.
Alone.
But I'll need your word that you will attack as soon as the fires have taken hold.
You have it.
If we succeed, Lord, you'll have saved Wessex.
 
[Odda] If he succeeds, fires the ships, it will undoubtedly cause panic amongst the Danes.
Which is the aim.
How best do we use that panic?
Is an attack likely to be successful?
Would it not be better to escape this hill?
We could return to Winchester without the loss of a single man.
Excepting Uhtred.
Father.
If what Uhtred says about the storm is true, and Guthrum's fleet is all but destroyed, we would join forces with Alfred.
We may well meet him on the road.
Then we are all against Ubba.
As a strategy, it makes sense.
I gave him my word.
He will die, and you can call him a hero.
The others are here.
You must decide what you will tell them.
I have called for you to tell you to read your men, all men, everyone.
We shall be moving soon.
Moving, Lord?
Ealderman Uhtred has volunteered himself to distract the Danes.
He will endeavor to set alight a number of their ships.
He has gone?
Yes.
Alone?
Yes.
If he should succeed in causing this distraction, we will move.
In which direction, Lord?
Ready your men. Tell them nothing.
Lord Odda, with respect, you told us nothing.
I've told you to ready your men.
Ready for battle?
Ready your men, each of you.
[Odda] Go.
Prepare.
 
 
I see nothing on the river.
It will soon be first light.
Can you not speak?
Very well.
Ships afire!
Ships afire!
[man] What's going on?
Fetch buckets and barrels!
Lord Odda, we are ready. But to do what?
He's done it.
Look. He's fired the ships.
We attack!
Lord? Lord, you awake?
Lord?
What?
The ships have been fired.
Oh!
It's him. I know it.
Yes.
You saw them dying on the hill.
Did you not see a fire?
I told you.
I can only see what the runes allow.
How many ships burn?
I don't know. Many.
They are planning something. They must be.
Lord?
There.
That's him.
You! Uhtred ragnarson!
You!
Are you afraid of me?
Man on man!
I will make the square!
Will you fight me?!
Are you the son of Ragnar the Fearless?
Or are you a coward?!
 
I will fight you, Ubba, if that's what you want, but you will die.
Fetch him a shield.
You're half-naked, Lord. You might catch chill.
This will not take long.
Was it you... the fires?
Must have been the gods.
They're angry with you.
First blood or to the death?
Get up. Get up!
You Saxon!
Go to Valhalla, Lord.
[Leofric] Shield wall!
Now kill the bastards!
Bind them tightly.
If any object, march them into the river!
Get this inside your belly, arseling.
God knows you deserve it.
Mm.
Lord Odda is hurt.
Badly.
He kept his word.
He would.
He's a good man.
A good ealderman.
I want Ubba buried with his axe.
His axe is gone.
Young Odda wants him cut into pieces.
No, that can't happen.
He would have done the same to him. He is Ubba... as close as the Danes will ever come to a King.
I'll see he's buried.
You... you have a task ahead.
You go directly to Alfred, and you kneel at his feet and tell the bastard you have saved Wessex.
No, I'll go to Mildrith.
If you don't do it, some other bugger will.
And there will be reward.
Men have seen it. They know what I have done.
Let them tell Alfred.
I need to see my son.
You're a turd.
[Uhtred] Lord.
I want to thank you for not abandoning me.
I know that would have been a choice... a reasonable choice.
I'll go to your estate now to see Mildrith and my son.
You served Alfred well today.
Thank you, Lord.
 
Who's there?!
Forgive me.
You looked too beautiful to disturb.
You may disturb me... Immediately.
[Mildrith] Uhtred, son of Uhtred.
Who is the son of another Uhtred and another.
He has a kingdom to inherit.
I'll see that it happens.
Tomorrow or the day after, we go home, and then to Winchester.
The three of us. Yes.
Oh.
I'll go to Alfred, and he will fall at my feet.
He will?
He will.
What?
He'll free us of our debt, at the very least.
And we will build a great hall and hold a feast.
I'd like that.
And I'd like Uhtred to be baptized in Winchester.
Father Beocca could perform the ceremony.
He'd be pleased.
Uhtred, it's what I want.
God is good, Uhtred.
He kept you safe.
He brought you home to me.
My sword kept me safe.
They've not yet gone to battle.
This is good.
I alone will speak.
Alfred is to hear one clear message.
How is the mood in the camp?
It's good, Lord.
The men are well.
Afraid?
No, no more than usual.
I...
I worry that I do not inspire them, that they do not see me as a warrior.
Lord...
Lord, it is Odda.
What is this?
Young Odda.
You have news. Where is your father?
He was wounded in battle.
A great battle at Cynuit, Lord.
But I have a gift for you.
Ubba is dead.
His army is defeated.
This is... this is true?
It is, Lord, two days ago.
Praise God. Praise him.
Well, then, Wessex is saved.
It is for a time.
Guthrum will have no choice now but to make peace.
While your father recovers, you will stand in his place.
His lands will be your hands and more.
Wessex is saved.
Everybody's walking to the palace.
A celebration.
Must be. A celebration of prayers.
Wo[man] Stop that!
I believe you did this.
[Beocca] The great hall is now full!
There is no more room!
Please, the King thanks you all for coming, but you need to pray here outside.
[Uhtred] Father Beocca!
The palace is full!
Father Beocca!
There will be ale and food available for everyone...
Father!
Uhtred?
You are here before me now?
I am, and with my child.
Oh, God be praised, you are alive.
Of course, I'm alive.
Why shouldn't I be alive?
You were at Werham, a hostage.
We thought you were dead.
No, father, I was at Cynuit.
I fought at Cynuit.
Did they not say?
I'll see Alfred now.
What is it?
Nothing I'm sure that cannot be resolved given time.
Uhtred!
I'll see Alfred.
No, Uhtred, Alfred is at peace!
Uhtred, please!
Uhtred!
Uhtred, your sword!
Forgive me, but I am told that you believe me dead?
Uhtred, this is not the time.
Father Beocca here believed me dead, and yet, just days ago, I was at Cynuit with Lord Odda.
It was Lord Odda and I who devised our battle plan.
Did the boy not say?
Uhtred, stop now.
Perhaps you'd like to speak now.
Odda, you will say nothing.
Perhaps you'd like to describe Ubba's death.
Lord, I would like to invite the ealderman here to join us in giving thanks and prayer.
Giving thanks? For what?
For victory? For the death of the pagan?
Who do you think killed the pagan?
I cannot save you.
I fought Ubba, man on man, and I killed him!
It was his axe against my sword!
This sword!
Is there any man here who will deny it?
[Alfred] Be still.
Everyone, be still, and be silent.
I have heard enough.
You have said enough. This is not seemly.
Now sheath your sword, and remember where you stand. Lord, what I'm saying to you... you have broken my peace.
You have broken the peace of Christ, and you have brought weapon into a sacred place.
Lord, I'm telling you the truth.
You will go directly to the courtyard, and you will wait for me to pass judgment!
Judgment? For what?
I've done nothing wrong.
You will be quiet!
We will...
We will continue with a moment of silence to help find the peace once more.
This interruption cannot be allowed to go unpunished.
It must be death.
Peace be with you, my dear.
 
Why are you unable to reason, to show patience?
All I expect is justice.
But it comes to those who have faith.
Now is not the time to talk of faith.
Now is precisely the time.
Now is when it's needed.
I'll have none of it.
You're too ready with anger.
There's a bad spirit within you that needs to be exorcised.
You should look to God.
I'll pray for you.
Humility is what you need.
What I need, woman, is justice!
Ohh!
 You sober?
Delicate.
You are to grovel.
What, again?
With me.
All I did was abscond from a monastery.
Ealderman Wulfhere.
You know this wretch, I believe.
We've met.
The King has sent me to punish you along with Aethelwold here.
What his wife would like is for me to pull your guts through your smelly ass.
Aelswith is forever inventive.
Lady, you are to go to Aelswith for comfort.
She waits in the chapel.
Do you know what the punishment is for drawing your sword before the King?
A fine.
Payable to the church, no doubt.
Death.
But Alfred is feeling merciful.
You will not dangle... not today.
He wants your assurance you will keep the peace.
What peace?
His peace, you fool.
It does not matter a gnat's dick that you killed Ubba.
What matters is that Odda the younger has claimed the credit.
Should his father die from his wounds, Odda becomes one of the richest men in Wessex, and men will want to praise his bravery.
My bravery.
Not a gnat's dick.
The sun now shines from Odda the younger's arsehole, and it is blinding.
Do you understand me?
Good.
You are to do penance.
I'm to do what?
[Aethelwold] Grovel.
You are to dress like a girl, go on your knees, and be humiliated.
I won't grovel.
Then Aelswith gets her wish, and I'll pull your guts through your arse.
Which will it be?
On your knees.
Now you will crawl all the way to the palace where you will kiss the cross and lie flat down on your face.
And then what?
God and the King will forgive you.
Go.
Go!
I will lead.
But you owe me.
What?
Oh!
Oh, Lord, I am a sinner!
Do not look at me!
You are!
I am a sinner, Lord, as big a sinner as you will ever see!
I have known women, Lord, lots and lots of women!
[man] Lucky bugger.
Women of all sizes.
The big tits, small tits.
I have squeezed and kissed them all.
I have rested my head on the bosoms of beautiful, but bad, bad women, Lord.
Forgive me!
I have lost count of the number of women I have had, but I know it is exactly half the number of tits I have caressed.
Oh, God, I love tits!
Send me an angel, Lord!
So you can hump her?!
A... a titless angel to guide me!
No more servant girls in my bedchamber, Lord.
Please.
I beg you.
You must lay flat, kiss the cross.
Kiss my arse.
You and your God.
Uhtred.
Uhtred, stop!
We're leaving this place.
We can't.
We're leaving. Collect your belongings.
It'll be dark soon, and there's the baptism.
It's important.
My son will not be baptized.
No priest will whisper lies and deceit into his ears and half-drown him in water.
Stop it. Stop it. You're just angry!
He will be a pagan, like his father!
Shh!
Why are you saying this?
We'll stay tonight, no longer.
I'll find you in the morning.
Where are you going?
Drinking and whoring.
I love tits!
And we appreciate the finer points of the tit.
The smaller tits, the manageable tit, the pert, eager, delighted tit.
The soft, enveloping tit, the tit that makes you feel at home.
How are your knees?
I can't laugh about it.
There's no justice here. Only the church.
You knew that.
I hear you're young Odda's man now.
I'm passed from father to son, yes, like the land.
I can't stay in Wessex.
You have a wife, a child you could not wait to see.
Where would you go?
Odda is afraid that you will kill him.
Tell him I might.
Tell him each night before he goes to bed.
I need to find wealth, but here, it's impossible.
The Danes, they would see it and take it.
Then that is what we do.
We become Danes, and we plunder.
Men will follow you.
Those men we have schooled, others who were at Cynuit, they will follow you.
You're saying that we raid?
We find wealth, and we take it.
Here in Wessex?
No.
You do not shit at your own table.
Cornwalum.
We take it from the Britons.
Do not say yes.
Not yet. Think.
I'll do the same.
But why should Odda be rewarded and not us?
 
Lord.
Welcome.
I was not expecting you home so soon.
Did the baptism go well?
That's a fine tree.
Good day, lady.
A miserable day.
Where was it felled, this tree?
On the top Ridge, Lord.
On my land?
Yes, Lord.
I'm taking it to Wigulf's mill for splitting.
He buys it?
He splits it, Lord.
We need... we need timber for repairs.
He takes his payments in split wood.
We need timber, why not split it ourselves?
Wigulf's always done it, Lord.
So if I go to Wigulf, he'll tell me how many such trees he has split, and you'll show me the timber?
How much is a tree like this worth?
8, 9 shillings?
I'm not certain, Lord.
How much does he pay you for my timber?
Lord, it is one tree.
How much does he pay you?
Lady, please.
How much does he pay you for my timber?
[Mildrith] Uhtred, no!
You be quiet!
Uhtred!
Uhtred!
That was justice.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SEASON: 01
EPISODE: 04
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[Uhtred] My name is Uhtred, son of Uhtred. I was born an ealdorman of Northumbria, the rightful heir to Bebbanburg. But fate decreed I would be raised as a Dane. That was my life... Until my family was murder.
Word was spread that I was to blame.
A Saxon slave, he killed his master at a wedding party.
And so, with Brida, I fled to Wessex. To Alfred, a man who would become King. Though not all agreed.
I am my father's heir.
I swore an oath to this King... An oath that lost me Brida and prevented me from joining my brother, Ragnar. But destiny is all.
 
You don't deserve to marry.
That woman is a lady, and you're a heathen.
You could bathe all day long, you'd still stink of pig shit.
Have you been watching me, Odda the boy?
Should I be marrying you?
10 pieces of silver for you to walk away.
Does your father know you're here?
11 pieces.
How about my sword's weight in silver?
Nonsense.
Then I'll marry the girl.
And tonight, I'll plough her.
Why must you talk of her like that?
Perhaps you'd like her for yourself, Odda?
You want her beneath you, am I right?
You're impossible to reason with.
Everything is a game.
I hope for Mildrith's sake your time on this earth is short.
You're not an ealdorman. You never shall be.
[man] Giddap!
I wasn't allowed to meet her. I haven't seen her.
It is the way.
I was unaware of her existence till yesterday.
She'll be plain and pious.
Oh, she'll be pious all right.
If she was a leg-spreader, Alfred would've been on her by now.
Have you seen her?
A distance away.
Plain is a fair description.
How much was the bride price?
33 pieces.
Which I've paid, to her godfather Odda, and which I'll make sure she receives.
I've made promises.
Revenge and such.
Why are you here?
Do you know?
She brings land.
I'll become a Lord under Alfred.
I'll be able to make wealth, gather men.
Take back what's mine.
All reasons enough.
Plain or not, she serves her purpose.
The promises you have made will stand.
Blood feuds last a lifetime.
What you do, arseling, is you keep living each day until the last.
The priest has arrived finally.
Let's get this done.
You do not need to "get this done."
I'll make a plea to Alfred.
She's here, praise God.
You should stand and look respectful, if not entirely clean.
How's she look?
Terrified, I'll bet.
 
If you could be brief with the ceremony, father Beocca, I would be grateful.
I have business with the King.
The bride has been given her price?
She will.
You are witness.
[Mildrith] Thank you, Lord.
If the betrothed couple would like to join me at the altar... and join hands.
Be brief.
May God in his heaven look down with mercy upon his devoted servants, Uhtred and Mildrith.
May he bless their union with love and children and wealth.
And may they, in turn, be sure to give thanks and praise, and live each day according to his holy word.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
You are now joined as man and wife in the eyes of God.
Tears of joy.
 
Allow me to help you with that.
Thank you, Lord.
I'm a lucky man, to have such a beautiful wife.
Must have been many suitors, I'm sure.
You're kind to believe so.
Am I right?
None suitable, Lord.
My name's Uhtred.
Call me Uhtred.
Arseling, time we were on our way.
Or, from time to time, you may wish to call me Arseling.
 
[Leofric] Lord...
Danes.
We walk on.
[Mildrith] They're following us.
We walk on. They won't attack.
Then why have you drawn your sword?
To show them at least one of them will die.
One or two.
They're Guthrum's men.
They're a long way from Lunden.
Lord, the marriage has taken place.
They're now on the road to the farmstead.
Good news. Thank you, Odda.
We shall now see how he responds to the challenge.
Now it is done, Lord, I do fear for Mildrith.
She will have to give him the facts.
Oh, he will bark at her, Odda, I'm sure.
But his real anger will be reserved for you and I.
He will not like being beholden to God and to King, but if he is to become a true ealdorman, he must accept his burden... that is the test.
Yes, Lord.
[Uhtred] Why are you not already married?
You're old enough to have two or three children by now.
Lord arseling, there's a time for such questions, and it is passed.
Why has Alfred gifted me such a beautiful bride?
Has a debt, I'm guessing.
It's not my place to tell you.
How much?
My father wanted to find favor with God, so he devoted a tenth of his land to the church.
They do not own it, but they are entitled to its yield.
Indeed, they demand its yield, even when crops fail and Danes raid.
God is good.
So the bishop took my father to law.
How much is the debt?
Church is the law, and the law decreed that my father owed them a huge sum...
Quite beyond his ability to pay.
How much?
He died soon after.
'Tis a substantial amount, Lord.
It increases yearly.
Alfred could remove the debt, but he has chosen not to.
The amount owed is 2,000 shillings, Lord.
Damn him.
Damn everything he stands for.
Damn his church and damn his God.
Lord, I must say, I do not like your blasphemy.
It is wrong.
My name is Uhtred!
By all means, call me arseling for not seeing this sooner.
[Mildrith] Your new home, Lord.
The land is good, but the buildings are in need of repair.
Look! The families who live on the land have come to wish us well.
Send them back to their homes.
They've come to wish us well.
I've known them my whole life.
Lord, lady.
Oswald manages the farmstead.
He lives nearby.
Welcome home.
And may we offer our good wishes on your marriage.
Thank you, Oswald. Thank you.
And how kind of you all to gather to greet me and my Lord, Uhtred.
We have prepared a table, Lord, for your pleasure.
You have my thanks, but we're tired.
Of course, Lord.
Thank you, Oswald. You are kind.
I have a wedding gift for each family.
'Tis silver.
Wo[man] Thank you, lady Mildrith.
For your kindness and your loyalty.
Thank you so much.
For taking care of the land in my prolonged absence.
Now, there's a welcome sight.
I was expecting there to be a hall, and I find this.
Pay off your debts and you can build a hall.
Didn't I tell you the bastard thinks?
Alfred.
If he believes he can make me beg, he can think again.
He doesn't want you to beg.
He wants you to obey.
Never.
If you have need for me, Lord, I'll be resting.
It seems I am tired.
I'm 2,000 shillings in debt to the church and you hand out silver to your tenants.
'Tis my silver.
You can have what's in my purse.
I don't want what's in your purse.
Then why scold me?
The stoat... your farmstead master.
His name is Oswald.
He'll need to be watched.
He was trusted by my father.
He lives too well by the look of him.
[Leofric] I'll make my way to the barn.
You're a guest. You can sleep in the house.
I prefer the barn. Thank you.
It is your wedding night.
Good night, lady. Arseling.
May I leave now?
How many pieces of silver did you receive?
As your price?
18.
Is that correct?
The price was 33.
I'm sure it was an honest mistake.
You were robbed.
As I was robbed.
That price is your security, and you'll have it.
All of it.
May I rest?
Yes.
I'm sorry the day has been a disappointment for you, Lord.
For us both.
You have a good heart... gifting your silver.
Odda owes you 15 pieces more.
I'll see that he pays.
And the debt's not something I blame you for.
It's Alfred's deceit.
I should've been wiser.
Though I was blinded by you.
You should eat.
I should eat.
But I don't want to eat alone.
God has made me your wife.
There must be a reason.
God is good.
 
What is it you're looking at?
There's a scar across the land. There.
The never-ending line of Danes on the march.
Ragnar.
[Ragnar] By the time word reaches Alfred, it will be too late.
They would need wings.
Go.
Oswald, what town lays in that direction?
If they keep going to the west, in a day or so, they'll come to the fortress at Werham.
Take your family and the others to the hills till we're sure they've passed.
Do it now.
And the lady Mildrith?
She travels with me.
To Winchester.
Yes, Lord.
[Leofric] How many do you see?
Question is how many will follow?
Wessex is being invade, and we're told to wait while he prays.
God is his strength, Uhtred.
He needs to be on horseback, not on his knees.
I hate this place.
It grows worse.
Mildrith.
I was not told you were here.
How pleasing to see you.
Lord.
And so much of you.
[Uhtred] Is he ready?
The King is ready, as is his council.
With me.
You watched 300 men or more march clean across Wessex and you did nothing?
[Uhtred] I'm here.
A messenger could've been sent in your place.
A boy.
Why did you not confront these Danes?
You have men.
That is your purpose, to create warriors.
I've been given barely 20 men and their wives, most of whom work the fields.
It would've been a slaughter, Lord.
But you chose not to fight. We'll never know.
A warrior can only die once. Why die in vain?
The Danes have traveled from either Lunden or East Anglia.
Were they not being watched?
We have been watching the ships, which remain on the tames.
A mistake.
If Werham is captured, the ships will follow.
300 men will become 3,000.
My advice is that we march without delay.
Don't recall the King seeking your advice.
Leofric, my trusted man, how many Danes did you witness?
More than 200 by far.
Warriors to a man.
Werham will struggle to hold them back.
The peace is over.
We have no choice but to march on Werham and pray God we arrive before the fortress falls.
You believe it is an invasion, Lord?
Could well be the beginning of a great Dane army, yes.
Council is over.
Ealdormen of Wessex, prepare your men.
Father Beocca, I shall pray before we leave.
Fr. [Beocca] Yes, my Lord.
Father, I wish to speak to the King privately.
I will ask.
But I note that you have still to learn respect.
Ealdorman Odda, if I may speak out, you owe my wife half of her bride price.
I paid 33 pieces of silver.
She received only 18.
An honest mistake, she assures me.
Is this true?
Pay him.
Ready the men to march on Werham.
You should know that Mildrith is a joy to plough.
You're a heathen.
And you're a virgin.
No, I'm not.
Yes, he is.
What is it? Hmm?
Promise me you will come back safely.
Two arms, both ears.
 Promise me.
I'll do my best.
But only if you do the same.
If they come, don't shelter in a church or a nunnery.
Go to the hills, the woods.
I'll come.
Hmm.
For both of you.
Arseling, kiss her and let's be on our way.
 
Mildrith, my dear. I've been looking for you.
My lady Aelswith. How good to see you.
And to see you looking as you do.
It refuses to keep still.
Mine is the same.
Oh, how we suffer.
I pray we both survive.
I pray we four survive.
God will decide.
Mm.
I've missed you, Mildrith, and have prayed for you each day.
Poor thing.
Why poor?
Living with the man they foisted onto you.
The pagan.
Having to take his seed and the like.
Uhtred is decent.
He treats me well.
He does.
God will bless your loyalty.
But with luck, he will fall in battle, and soon.
Please tell me that you're hungry.
I am, a little.
Meet me in the kitchens.
I have arranged a meal for the pregnant.
But do not rush prayers.
No, no. Of course not.
Lord, he is not your most humble and devout servant, but I pray... keep him safe.
Let him do your work.
Let him see his child.
I was pleased to see your lady today.
Your wife... and carrying a child.
 Yes.
It's God's blessing.
It seems like only yesterday I was baptizing you as Osbert, and then again as Uhtred.
What is it you wish to speak about with the King?
That's ween myself and the King.
He's watching you, Uhtred.
God?
Alfred.
He's watching how you behave.
He's judging you as a Lord.
He has no right to judge.
He's a King.
He lied to me.
Regarding the marriage.
Oh, you're referring to the debt?
You know of it?
It's not a secret.
And I urge you to show him you accept it, especially as it is owed to the church.
You must remain calm, Uhtred.
Respectful.
My Lord, I request a private audience...
Have you eaten?
No.
There are times when I crave meat... and other things.
But I know the gratification will be fleeting, the suffering prolonged, and so I suffer gruel.
Though my wife will not allow it to be called anything other than broth.
You will be happy to learn that my spies have news.
From Werham?
From Ireland.
Ivar, the brother of Ubba, has been killed there, which would be irrelevant but for the fact that Ubba wishes to avenge him personally.
This is true?
An Irishman across the sea kills a Dane, and the world changes.
The hand of God.
Is this something Ubba would do, abandon Guthrum?
To avenge his brother, yes... if guided by his sorcerer's story.
He has a sorcerer?
And, uh... what does this sorcerer do?
Cast spells? Perform magic?
He advises, Lord.
Looks for omens.
Signs, good and bad.
Oh, what nonsense.
What are miracles, Lord, if not magic?
Miracles are performed by God, not man.
The Danes would say the same, that omens are gifts from the gods...
And they are mistaken.
Who gave the sign for Ubba to go to Ireland?
Was it the hand of your God or theirs?
There is only one God.
Then you must've spoken to the Danes.
With Ubba now in Ireland, Guthrum must now decided whether he will fight alone.
He won't fight alone.
Not that he couldn't win.
He will fear losing too many of his own men.
Yes, Lord.
I am learning... that the heathen cares only for personal gain.
A Dane could never suffer my gruel.
Broth, Lord.
You are happy, ealdorman Uhtred, with, Mildrith?
Yes, Lord. She's a good wife.
Though I never would have married her had I known I'd owe 2,000 shillings.
Which increases yearly.
I'm told that on your word, the debt can be lifted.
Why should I deny the church 2,000 shillings?
I wasn't aware I'd owe it.
It is not a secret.
Sacrifice and penance are what separate us from the heathen.
I have my broth. You have your debt.
Wessex needs an army. Would you agree?
A permanent and formidable army.
Yes, Lord.
England, when it finally emerges, shall need a greater army.
Garrisons of many thousands of men all will need feeding and payment.
It is my intention that all land owners shall contribute to the feeding of this army and its commanders.
And I will need commanders, Uhtred.
Men like the great generals of Rome.
Look upon the debt as a gift.
A means of proving your devotion to Wessex and to England.
If I'd been told the truth from the outset, Lord, I could've...
You still wear the amulet, I see. to remind me of Earl Ragnar.
And why do you not attend church with your wife?
Why do you not pray to God?
God... created everything that surrounds me... the fields, rivers, the forests.
The land is my church.
And I pray each day, Lord.
In silence.
He cannot be tamed.
But he can be trusted.
I will not abandon him completely.
He may have a use, I'm sure.
 
Hear me now! Werham has fallen!
We march at once!
Every man is to be ready to do as the King asks!
The Danes have taken the fortress!
Werham has fallen! We march at once!
We could be slipping in blood and entrails before the day is out.
With luck.
 
[man] There's loads more over here!
Easy. There's enough for everyone.
Guthrum, they're here.
The Saxon army is gathering.
Is it Alfred?
Yes.
Is the fortress repaired and secure?
Yes.
Good.
He will not attack. He doesn't need to.
He knows we will be hungry within days.
We can raid.
No.
He will empty all the grain stores in the surrounding villages.
I have found these church rooms to be strangely quiet and peaceful.
Lord, I didn't march my men halfway across England for them to starve.
I shall be on the ramparts.
We came for war, Ragnar.
But Ubba has reneged.
To avenge his brother.
You are here.
Should you not be avenging your father?
When the time is right.
Yes. When the time is right.
We are taking the first steps against Wessex.
But Ubba has left us weak.
He put all our lives at risk.
So until Ubba returns, we have to make peace.
So if you are there, God of Rome, strike me down.
I thought not.
We are here to show them how many we are.
We are here to show them how many we are!
That we are here with God, and that this is our land.
That we are here with God, and this is our land!
This is our land!
Our Wessex!
This is our England!
And we shall murder any heathen bastard that tries to take it!
They wish to talk, Lord.
[Alfred] I know what they want.
They want time.
Odda, with your guards, you shall go with me.
Leofric, you as well.
And father Selbix.
Yes, Lord.
Leofric, what do you make of the fortress?
It looks strong enough, Lord.
No breach. No signs of lasting damage.
And if we attacked?
We would suffer.
We'd be lucky to see the inside, Lord.
Good morning, King Alfred.
Guthrum of the Danes.
I, too, am a King now.
Of East Anglia.
You don't need to bow.
I will begin.
I propose a truce.
For any truce to occur, Earl Guthrum, you must leave Wessex once again.
And if I refuse?
We surround you.
Yes, you surround a small fortress, but we Danes surround your entire kingdom.
That said, I have decided I shall leave.
By sea.
Therefore I will send for ships.
How many ships?
No more than 15.
Very well.
Your ships have one month in which to arrive.
Not enough time.
Food and ale for one month only or you will walk back to East Anglia.
Then I will send for 200 ships and hope they arrive before we starve.
One month is not enough.
That is my limit.
You cannot take back the fortress.
You know this.
Food and ale for one month, no more, by which time the sea storms will have arrived.
God's storms.
We will be gone within a month... beginning upon the delivery of food and ale.
Uhtred, you will come to me following prayers.
Yes, Lord.
Father Selbix, you will pray with me.
Yes, Lord.
[Alfred] Please, sit.
Thank you, Lord.
I have a task for you, father.
Mm, you only have to speak it.
As a guarantee of the peace, you will be given up as a hostage... 1 of 10.
The Danes, too, will give 10 in exchange.
Lord... the pagans do not value priests.
You might just as well offer a hound.
I hear Guthrum is curious about our faith.
I would like you to become his teacher.
Provide instruction.
And if he refuses to be a student?
Then persist.
Gently, with humor, as is your manner.
Make no mistake... should Guthrum ever consent to being baptized, then this war is over.
England is ours.
This would be truly God's work you do.
Forgive me, Lord, but I cannot help but feel afraid.
They are not content to simply kill a priest.
Fear is within all of us.
As is strength.
Lord, I'd be more useful as a warrior... for when the truce fails.
Oh, the truce will hold for a time.
And in that time, you will be my eyes and ears inside the fortress.
Listening for what?
For Ubba.
If and when you hear of his return, you will escape.
And if I'm in chains?
Our men here shall disband.
There are fields to work.
But I will build a beacon on the hill.
You will escape and light the fire.
Lord, you know that escape will be near impossible.
If Ubba returns, the hostages will be killed and the Danes will attack.
Upon sight of this first beacon being lit, other fires will start, and the whole of Wessex will be called to arms.
And if I refuse to become a hostage?
Then another man shall light the beacon.
Why can't you accept me?
I've been nothing but truthful to you.
Why am I always being put to the test?
Why do you not show your King the respect that is due? Because you, Uhtred of wherever, you do not see me as your King.
You do not see my God as your God.
Lord...
I am not finished with you yet.
Guthrum is waiting to hear of Ubba's return from Ireland.
I need to know when this occurs, sooner rather than later.
You are the only man who could possibly provide this information sooner.
Yes, it is possible that you will die, but it is likely that we shall all die.
You will go to the Danes.
How you go, as a Saxon hostage or as a viking warrior, becomes your choice.
I'll do as you ask.
But if my child is born while I'm captive, I ask that you send word.
Of course.
And should you die as a captive, rest assured, your debt shall die with you.
Will they treat us well?
You are one of them.
If I am one of them, then why am I a hostage?
They'll treat us well for as long as the truce holds.
If it fails?
They'll kill us all.
Starting with the priest.
Heh.
I've made my peace. I am ready.
Good evening.
And God bless you all.
Poor wretches.
And us, father, what are we?
We are fortunate, Lord. We know God.
Although, granted, I'm in no hurry to meet him.
Let us pray he feels the same.
Is this rabble what so many are afraid of?
Aah! They're like children!
Enough. Enough!
They are our guests for a while.
There's one rule only.
At nightfall, you will gather and sleep at the church.
The doors will be barred.
At daybreak, you will then be free to walk, talk, jump, hump, carry weapon.
My men have orders not to kill you.
Unless you deserve to be killed.
I am Guthrum, and one day, I shall be your King.
Do you understand what I have said?
You will all say "yes, Lord."
Yes, Lord.
Yes, Lord.
I did not hear you.
I understand you, Lord.
Maybe I will make a present of you to Ubba.
Should he ever return from Ireland.
He may not. That's possible.
But then his men will become my men, and I will honor him by killing you myself.
With arrows, perhaps.
Ragnar Ragnarsson. Here.
You know this one well. Keep him out of my sight.
Take them to the church. Feed them.
Now you are where you belong.
Now I'm with my brother.
I will remind you what it's like to be a Dane and make you stay.
Brida's here.
I dream about you, ViXen.
I'm not surprised to hear it.
You've grown up. 
You should know I'm with Ragnar now.
He's my man.
That's good. That's good.
You should know that I am married.
Married!
You have grown up.
He's married?
Yes, he is married.
Time is moving quicker than I thought.
Tonight, we get drunk.
We must.
I need to be inside the church.
No, tonight we get drunk.
I'll take you to the church myself.
Or we sleep where we fall.
And, uh... we must talk of the future.
Pull! Pull! Uhtred, pull for me!
I need to piss. I'll return.
He'll return.
Ragnar!
Ragnar! Ragnar!
I haven't laughed so much in a long time.
Then you haven't been living.
Or as ravn would say, tomorrow we die.
When did he ever say that?
When you were out chopping wood.
Ohh!
Well, I actually do need to piss.
What you need to do is to stop drinking.
Tomorrow we die.
He's happy to see you.
I've missed him.
I miss you both.
Are you his wife?
I'm with him.
Is she beautiful?
Mm.
Her name's Mildrith.
Yes, she is beautiful.
She carries my child.
Who decided you should marry?
Alfred.
I have the land I asked for in Wessex.
You swear an oath to Alfred... you marry for Alfred, you've land given to you by Alfred... your wife carries your child, and yet you're given up as a hostage by Alfred?
Are you a spy, Uhtred?
The first sign of Ubba returning, I am to escape.
But I know that when Ubba returns, the hostages will be killed.
 Alfred's not fond of me.
Refuse him.
Refuse to be a hostage. Join us.
I should ask you, Uhtred... not that it matters, but I should ask.
Is it a problem to you that Brida's with me now?
 No.
I'm happy about it. I swear.
All right.
Not that she cares what you think.
I would hump her regardless.
With... with affection.
And with my permission.
I know.
Do you know Uhtred's to be a father?
A father?
When?
Soon, I'm told.
You would want to see it?
Yes.
I hope to return to my wife and child.
Ragnar, I'll be with you to avenge our father.
Kjartan will pay.
You should've joined me months ago.
With Brida.
I had sworn an oath.
To a poxy Saxon King.
Ubba wanted to see me dead.
There was nowhere else to go.
You know, I have thought about that night in the woods.
You had the choice to be a Saxon or a Dane.
No. No, I had sworn an oath.
You should've joined me.
I'll be with you to kill Kjartan.
I will take you to the church.
To your bed.
It's a son, lady.
A handsome boy.
You will be Uhtred, son of Uhtred.
Good morning, Uhtred.
Morning, father.
Raining again.
One day seems like the next.
 It does.
Still, at least we're alive to feel it.
How are your conversations with Guthrum?
Is he a Christian yet?
I believe the time is near. I do.
Onward. God bless you.
May you enjoy a good day.
Thank you, father.
He is the King of Kings.
Capable of great, great things.
Such as what?
Such as miracles.
 Miracles.
Such as what?
Such as... you, Lord.
You are a miracle.
He has made you strong yet merciful.
He has made you proud yet humble.
He has given you free will, hoping that you will find the courage to choose him above all else.
And I believe... I truly believe he will be rewarded.
I have a message for Guthrum.
[man] He's in the church.
Lord, may I speak?
Freely.
Ubba and his army have returned from Ireland.
They are coming ashore north of here, at the Severn.
And my fleet is where?
They left Lunden several days ago and are nearly here, Lord.
Every last ship will be here.
Every man will be with you.
That is good news.
I dispatch you to heaven.
No need to thank me.
Father!
Ubba has returned?
Did they say?
 Yes.
[Guthrum] Men, the peace is over. Prepare for battle.
The Saxon hostages, kill them all.
Catch him! Get him!
Cut him to pieces!
Seize him!
Aah!
Leave him!
I say leave him!
Ragnar.
Please, step aside.
You know all the hostages have to die.
Then kill him. You're welcome to kill him.
But you have to kill me first.
I could happily manage without this.
He's a Saxon.
He's a traitor. He's an enemy.
Well, to get to him, you'll have to kill me.
My men, they will not follow you.
I will give you one last charity.
Release him... without a horse.
Are you all right?
I have no words.
You should go. Go and see your child.
Go.
Yes.
I'll be with you.
Both of you.
 
 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SEASON: 01
EPISODE: 03
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[Uhtred] I was born an ealdorman of England, true heir to the Northumbrian lands of Bebbanburg. I was 12 years old when I first went to war. I saw my father killed. Stolen by the invade, along with a Saxon girl, Brida, I became, first, a slave, and then, a son to Earl Ragner. Fate had made me a Dane, had made young Ragner my brother; and Brida, my lover. And then, fate brought betrayal.
fire!
Aaaaah!
Lies were thrown to the wind, saying I had killed Ragner, so, taking his hidden wealth, we fled south...
 
to Wessex, to Beocca, and to the King's brother Alfred.
Seen by the Danes as a Saxon and by the Saxons as a Dane, my word could not be trusted.
But I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred, and destiny is all.
       
Stand clear. It is the King.
I have to speak, Lord.
The axe cut deep.
Even a King couldn't survive that wound.
We shall pray and we shall see.
Move!
   
Apologies, Lord.
This is the best I could do without first speaking to Alfred.
I've brought food and ale and, more importantly, good news.
Alfred is dead?
The opposite.
He is alive and he is victorious.
We defeated the Danes.
Agh! Anh!
Why is this good news?
Alfred acted upon your advice.
You share in his glory.
Glory?
Then why is he caged and left to shit in the corner?
You call that glory?
Can she not hold her tongue for just one moment?
No, she cannot!
And she will not!
Keep your food! I don't want it!
Only... only...
I won't eat or drink until I'm set free!
Only Alfred can order your release!
I will speak with him!
You should spend this time, girl, to contemplate your improvement.
I will use this time to curse you.
Then do it.
Alfred refused my sword.
I won't be offering it again, unless he begs.
Lord, sometimes I wonder whether your pigheadedness is not simple stupidity.
He will send for you when he has scraped the mud and blood from his mail.
We will give thanks to Odin for our deliverance.
Do that.
We are Danes!
Show respect!
Do it again, and I will cut you, prick to throat.
[Alfred] What is it?
I couldn't wait to see you.
I was told you were safe, but I needed proof.
Here it is.
Leave us. My wife will help me.
My Lord.
My privilege.
Ensure it is repaired, and well.
I'd be a lost fool without you.
Fingers and thumbs.
Who knocks?
My Lord.
My Lady, forgive me.
I was hoping for a moment to discuss the ealdorman Uhtred.
Father, forgive me, but my Lord is in need of rest.
He is.
You are.
Forgive me.
Aethelwold, were you on the hill?
I didn't see you.
I was kept safe with priests.
There will be other battles.
Many.
And on and on it will go, I'm sure, 'til we're all dead.
Are you saying we should surrender?
Never.
Never.
But I'm not against compromise.
As much as I love my God, I'm in no hurry to reach heaven.
I fear no number of kneeling clergymen will change what a heathen's axe has already decreed.
Our prays should be with the King's successor, whoever that may be.
The crown is mine, my birthright.
You disagree?
The argument against you will be that you're a young Lord. I am my father's heir.
Yes, you are your father's heir, but your father was also bonded to Alfred.
A son comes before a brother.
Then, perhaps, you should speak to the King directly.
'Tis my thinking, Lord, that if, on his deathbed, your father were to name you as his successor, the witan would find it difficult to go against him.
I believe your father would only be too happy to whisper in your ear.
Whether he was conscious or not.
Your counsel will not be forgotten, young Odda.
Thank you, Lord.
Guthrum.
You went into battle without me.
Why was that?
That was not the intention.
Is that so?
Then why did it happen?
Let's talk inside.
We will talk here.
They marched sooner than we expected and they positioned themselves well on the hill.
It will not happen again.
No, it will not happen again, because you have lost half your men.
We killed their King, Aethelred.
Did you see him fall?
Yeah, I saw him fall.
He took an axe.
He's dead. We were not beaten.
Hmm, you want to become King of Wessex.
I will allow that.
But where's my payment, my silver, my grain?
It was promised, but now it has gone.
It's still there.
Danes do not lose.
I am not lost.
You have given them hope, Guthrum, that is worse.
Without their King, there is no hope.
If they've defeated the Danes, which I won't believe, why aren't they feasting?
The priest doesn't lie.
Despite him being a priest.
Why are they so different, so miserable?
God's wish. 
I won't become a Saxon woman.
I won't wash, work the fields 'til I drop, and cook. It won't come to that.
That won't be my life.
Alfred can help us.
We'll use him  for shelter, and then for wealth.
He has used you.
And, now, he owes me.
Good morning.
My thanks for last night.
 
Open the door. I wish to see my father.
 
Open the door, or I'll have your balls for slingshot.
Aethelwold.
I'm here to pray for my father, the King, to be at his side.
The King is dead.
Why was I not called?
I should have been at his side.
You could not be found.
I was sleeping in my chamber.
   
   
Before he passed, the King named me as heir to the throne.
 
That's what he told me.
It's the truth.
His last wish.
His last command.
You would all do well to repeat this.
 
I'll inform the witan of your claim.
You should.
Although each person here, and more, heard your father bequeath his crown to Alfred.
He must have been delirious. 
On which occasion?
I am the son of the King.
Do your duty.
 
My Lord.
Ah, Uhtred.
Please accept my apology for the delay in your release.
I had other matters to attend.
Ale, father?
A little.
And for our guests.
It seems you spoke the truth.
I did.
Though I realize our victory is temporary, I am indebted.
Wessex is indebted.
Is my apology enough?
It's not, Lord.
What Uhtred means is that it is not necessary.
I wish to be seen as an ealdorman, because I am an ealdorman.
In Northumbria. This is Wessex.
This is England.
One kingdom is what you said.
You are without lands completely.
And that's what I want.
That's what I deserve, land.
I brought you here solely to convey my thanks, but we shall talk further, at some point.
Now, I have other, more important, matters to attend.
I gave you victory, Lord.
What's more important than that?
The King is dead.
Since when?
I have not long left him.
 
My first act as King will be to offer the Danes a peace.
They will think you spineless.
Lord.
Then I must convince them otherwise.
 
Girl, bring some fruits to my chamber, some chopped apples and milk.
Rest, wash, eat well.
You have earned it.
 
What are you saying?
You do not speak to a future King in that manner.
He's not my Lord and he won't be my King.
Hear me clearly, Uhtred.
Alfred is the man to follow.
He is your way back to Bebbanburg, as Lord and Master.
Uhtred's path is Uhtred's business, not that of a priest.
Forgive me, Lord.
I must leave, to pray for strength and to expunge these unholy thoughts that fill my mind.
You want land in Wessex?
It's my way back to Bebbanburg.
Any silver you find under Alfred will be taken by the Danes.
Along with your life.
They can't be beaten.
Excuse me, my Lord.
I am on an errand to my Lord Alfred.
The milk is for Alfred?
It is.
 
Not a word.
Go on.
 
Uah!
 
Master Aethelwold, the man-child who would have himself be King.
Out of respect for the late King, Alfred wishes no harm to be done to a hair of your ugly head.
But he will not put up with your insolence and lies.
Your own son is party to my so called insolence.
Quiet!
Don't you involve others in your conspiracies.
My head is not ugly.
You're to be sent to Hampton, to a monastery, to be educated.
It will be a very long process.
I am the King's son!
Wessex cannot afford division.
Nor can it afford the ramblings of an idiot child, noble or otherwise.
See to it.
May I make him docile, Lord?
I wish you would.
No. No, no, no, no, no!
[Alfred] Come.
Lord, you wish to see me.
I did. I did.
You will take a message to Guthrum, to the Danes.
You will invite them to negotiate, within days, but at their own convenience.
I shall gladly be your representative, Lord.
Thank you.
Do I offend you, watching you?
No, my Lord, never.
I will defend you with my life.
You stand as everything that is precious.
You are Wessex, England, always to be cherished, never to be violated.
Only to be loved.
Vigorously.
Who is it?
My Lord.
My conscience.
My Lord, would you care to join me in prayer, perhaps for the passing of the King?
I will, father.
I give you my thanks.
Forgive me, my Lord.
The milk has soured.
I am tired of milk and apples.
I need meat.
But you are a martyr, my Lord, to meat.
My Lord needs feeding.
My Lord is not a Saint, and never shall be.
I have survived battle.
I need meat.
We shall pray together, my Lord, for strength.
Why does it have to be a sin?
Already, it is a burden.
 
It seems never to be about what I would wish to do.
It is about what I must do.
 
Ask God to give me the strength to wear the crown as well as you.
Father Beocca, a moment.
Yes, Lord?
Uhtred may well have a use.
I'm...
Pleased that is what you think, Lord.
This Brida, she's what, to him?
I would say a hindrance, Lord.
A wife?
No, no, never, no.
She is restless.
She's the devil on his shoulder, I fear.
But he is fond of her.
Yes, that is his way.
We shall see.
Thank you.
My Lord.
       
I carry a message from King Alfred.
Who is King Alfred?
He is Alfred, King of Wessex.
He invites the Earl Guthrum to negotiate a peace.
Get down from your horse, boy.
You are a beauty.
Tell this King...
What was his name?
Alfred.
Tell King Alfred that Guthrum accepts his invitation and I shall watch for him and I shall ride out and meet him.
I will pass on your message, Lord.
This horse belongs to me now.
 
Uhtred, Alfred is keen to find a use for you, but Brida is...
She's not a help.
Well, perhaps you could just keep her away from me.
Alfred knows how I can be of use.
Uhtred... and I've proven it.
Now, he must prove he can be of use to me.
He will be King.
And you can serve him.
I'm here to serve myself.
Alfred means nothing to me but a path to take back what's rightfully mine, my land, my wealth, and my title.
He will have a use for me, but I'll have a use for him.
Do not think him naive.
He will see right through you.
He will see what I allow him to see.
You looking for company, girl?
I prefer the company of the Gods to stupid men.
Another time, then.
                   
Ahem.
Good morning, Uhtred.
Good morning, Lord.
That's a fine coat of mail.
It is, and it is yours, the battle dress of a Saxon warrior.
A gift.
In return for what?
There's always a price.
Which you have paid in full our victory at the hill.
Young Odda, have you offered your apologies to Uhtred?
My sincere apologies.
You spoke the truth.
A small bow, perhaps?
You may leave us now.
A good King relies upon good advice, Uhtred.
For example, my nephew Aethelwold, the King's son, he is young, but sees himself as the rightful heir.
How am I to deal with him?
You should kill him, Lord.
As my own uncle Aelfric would kill me.
Not to kill him shows weakness.
You're being insolent.
I will allow it.
It is the pagan in him speaking.
You think like a Dane, Uhtred.
If I kill Aethelwold, I am admitting he has legitimate claim to the throne, which he does not. That is how I think.
But to have a specimen of the heathen mind in council will be useful.
What do they fear most, the Danes?
They're warriors. They live to fight.
But when they lose, as at the hill, what then?
In battle, they'd rather retreat than lose too many men, so, if they fear anything at all, it's losing men.
They love to fight, but hate to lose?
Hardly a revelation.
Odda appears not to value your council.
I do not.
I care not.
I have been thinking on your request to be recognized as an ealdorman.
Which is a nonsense.
I am an ealdorman.
Without even a goat to your name, never mind the land to graze it.
I am an ealdorman by birth. Would you perhaps consider becoming an ealdorman by marriage?
I know of a marriage that would being you land and title.
I have no need of a wife, Lord.
A woman helps you grow. Grow old.
Grow roots, and that is what you are missing.
Marriage would show your commitment to Wessex.
I have shown commitment.
You've said yourself I gave you victory at the hill.
You helped, Uhtred, but the victory was won by the men of Wessex.
Whom you now refuse to join through this marriage.
Land and silver is what all men desire and I'm no different.
But believe me, Lord, I have no need of a wife.
My sword is yours.
At a price.
Everything that I have has been taken from me.
I need title.
I need to make my wealth.
Are you offering me your sword or are you selling me your sword?
To become an ealdorman, you must possess land.
That is the law.
However, stand at my side during the negotiations ahead, help me read my enemy, and, in return, we shall talk further of wealth and reward.
Oh.
Agh.
Well, what did you see?
Hmm? What did they show you?
What I saw is my business.
Ah! I feel unwell.
Here.
Water.
Where we find ourselves is fate.
The work of the three spinners, they sit deep in this earth beneath us and they've brought us here.
We should go.
To Cornwalum, Wales, Ireland... anywhere.
Why?
Escape.
 
Safety.
I saw Ragnar's ship.
The past.
No, wind viper.
Young Ragnar?
I was there, on the ship.
I saw it.
I want to leave here.
Come with me.
Come with me.
I've given a promise to Alfred.
To attend the negotiations, to advise.
 
Brida, there's no place else for us to go.
We cannot stay here.
 
It's a beginning.
 
Leave me.
We cannot wander the country and do nothing.
How can you trust him?
How do you know he won't simply turn you over to Guthrum to pass on to Ubba?
You know nothing about him.
I trust father Beocca and Beocca is his priest.
I said, "leave me."
 
You were not on the ship with me!
Go to Alfred and I will watch him betray you.
   
So, what do we know of this Alfred?
That he's sickly.
He's weak.
He wants to negotiate.
Turns out that he's no warrior.
But he beat you, Guthrum.
So, what does it say?
Negotiation.
Silver.
We will take his silver.
And his land.
And if he refuses?
He will never refuse.
He wants to live and he wants to be called King.
       
   
     
Our God in His heaven, we ask You to find favor with your devoted servant Alfred.
Bless him with courage, strength, and wisdom.
Never leave his side.
Amen. Amen.
Allow him pure and holy thoughts and the power to carry out your work on this earth as our King.
Allow this anointing of Alfred to enable your will.
You are God's King, Alfred of Wessex.
Vivat Rex Alfredus!
 Vivat Rex Alfredus! Vivat Rex Alfredus. Vivat Rex Alfredus! Vivat Rex Alfredus. Vivat Rex Alfredus! Vivat Rex Alfredus. Vivat Rex Alfredus! Vivat Rex Alfredus. Vivat Rex Alfredus. Vivat Rex Alfredus. Vivat Rex Alfredus. Vivat Rex Alfredus.
I can't imagine a time without you.
Vivat Rex Alfredus. Vivat Rex Alfredus. Vivat Rex Alfredus.
   
It is Guthrum?
Yes.
You can see a bone in his hair.
It's his mother's rib.
How endearing.
And the others?
It's Ubba. The big man.
The chieftain Ubba is with him?
You said he was in the north.
Now, he's here.
This is good.
[Guthrum] So you are Alfred, the King of Wessex?
I am.
You are Earl Guthrum?
Yes.
If you want peace, you have to pay.
And you are the Earl Ubba.
Welcome.
Speak.
In exchange for an agreed amount of grain, livestock, and silver, I propose that you and your ships return to London and remain there.
I further propose that you confine yourselves to east Anglia, Mercia, and Northumbria.
Wessex is Saxon, and, as such, out of bounds to all Danes.
We'll not be leaving Wessex.
We only just arrived.
Then you will starve.
You have little food, no shelter, and a weakened army.
If you believe us weakened, why seek peace?
It is the Christian in me.
The will of my God.
Oh, I'll hear no talk of Gods.
God.
There is only one.
You will talk of grain, horses, silver, and land.
I will not talk of land.
What do they write?
They write what we speak.
Every word?
Yes, every word.
Then may I say arse, tits, hump, and turd?
They record history.
We are here creating history.
People will read of this very meeting.
I'm waiting to hear the terms of your surrender.
You will be paid for your return to London.
There are no more terms, and there will be no surrender.
Guthrum here will not leave Readingum.
And I say again he will starve.
We will raid. We will kill.
And you will lose yet more men.
Is that your wish, Earl Guthrum, to lose men?
Your surviving warriors may look to find a new Lord.
Did you call the meeting to insult me?
I offer peace and I offer facts.
His head, and you can have your peace.
Him.
Uhtred Ragnarson.
A traitor.
Nothing to say?
I'll speak to young Ragnar.
No other Dane has my respect.
His head for peace.
You want Uhtred here for peace?
No silver, no grain, no horses?
We want silver... and the traitor's head.
These are the terms. And you, Alfred,  You may remain King, but we will occupy all of the Saxon forts.
If you wish to occupy the fortresses, then do it, take them.
How many have you taken, to date?
Father, how many have they taken to date?
None, Lord.
We can take all fortresses at any time!
We have taken the whole of England!
And we can do the same with Wessex.
Let me be clear.
I am prepared to return to the sword... we outnumber you, we are many, and we are dangerous...
But I would prefer to establish a peace.
And Uhtred here shall keep his head, but I will pay you well to leave Wessex.
That is what people will read.
That Alfred sought peace.
Alfred paid Lords Ubba and Guthrum in silver, in exchange for peace.
It is I who is seeking an end to the fighting.
That is what will be written.
     
Uhtred.
I would never have given you up to Ubba.
But the thought did cross your mind, Lord.
Not once.
The fact is I would like you to swear an oath on holy relics... a year's service.
During which time, you will help my warriors understand that the heathens are but men.
And, in return and in time, you shall have your own reward...
Uhtred of Bebbanburg.
One year.
 
Boy!
 
For the King.
   
They have been halted, but nothing more.
They are not defeated.
Our task, now, is both simple and impossible... we determine what they will do next.
They will do what Danes always do, attack.
How, where, when, how many?
We're supposed to be celebrating a peace.
Do we have to talk of fighting?
We do, my dear, because the peace will not last.
It'll take them at least a year before they can gather a second great army.
Do I have your word?
Son.
Is there any meat here?
Should she even be here?
Brida's my guest.
You should've taken up the King's offer of a wife.
A lady.
What happens next, I believe, is that they will come by land and sea.
They will split our army in two, possibly more.
Now, Uhtred may be correct, this may not occur for a year, or more, but what is clear is that we need ships.
We are bordered by water, but, yet, we have so few ships.
You'll not get me on a ship.
I volunteer my son.
To save our shores, we have to look beyond them.
And to serve God, His word must travel.
Amen. Praise Him.
Uhtred, the beasts on the prows of the Danes' ships, they are a... representation of their Gods?
No, Lord, they're just beasts.
They can be lifted from their posts, so not to frighten the spirits of the land.
"Spirits of the land." 
I would like to know why some of them make their own teeth into points.
They do that?
Some, lady.
God save us.
To show that they aren't afraid.
If they can inflict such pain on themselves, think what they might do to a Saxon.
We will understand them more by the day, I'm sure.
Uhtred of the Danes has promised me a year of his service.
Is that so?
It is.
It will be his responsibility to show our warriors how the Danes approach battle, the construction of their shield wall, wall and the like.
Lord, if I may, the arseling here is barely a man and you expect him to teach me how to fight?
Leofric, I expect him to teach you nothing.
Whip him with staves, in practice, by all means.
Thank you, Lord.
But, our lesser men, if they can know what the Dane knows, fear can be expelled with knowledge, regardless how sharp their teeth.
You didn't eat tonight.
I'd only throw it up.
A year?
It starts with a year and becomes a lifetime.
And he offered you a wife.
I have no need of a wife.
Instead, you swore an oath to kill Danes.
You know my reasons.
We've been living in a palace.
What happens if you find yourself facing young Ragnar, in battle?
We fight.
Where is she?
I haven't heard her all morning.
She will not be far.
Well, we're about to leave.
Yeah, I can see.
I'll follow.
     
[Uhtred] Brida!
 
Brida!
 
Brida!
 
Brida?
   
Almost a child.
You knew?
Hmm?
That you were carrying.
 
No.
You didn't see it in your dreams, when you drank the mushroom ale?
 
I'll bury it.
We'll bury it.
It's a sign of a passing.
 
Stand together!
Shields front!
Shields up!
Shields together!
Look them in the eye.
Closer together, unbreakable.
Are we ready?!
Yeah!
Stand together!
Unh!
Ah!
Shields together!
We hammer them with our shields.
They're our defense and our weapon.
We knock them off their feet.
We're a wall!
 
Cha-a-a-a-rge!
Ahhhhhh!
 
Before the two walls meet, the first three rows of men act together to create a tall shield wall.
First row crouches lower, protecting the lower body and legs.
The second row reaches forward, protecting the upper body.
The third row leans in, protecting the head.
Four rows of men.
Shields up.
Shields together!
Shield wall!
I like it, arseling.
I do.
Now, kill the bastard.
 
The wealth isn't mine.
Belongs to Lord Ragnar, the Fearless.
You will do well to leave me alone.
Are you Brida?
Who asks?
Brida.
What of her?
I'm no seer, but I'd say she's unhappy.
She prefers the company of Danes to Saxons.
Nothing wrong in that.
She's been with the wrong Saxons.
Danes have a hunger for life.
Don't we all?
Alfred... he's serious.
A pious bastard.
Dislike him, by all means, but never underestimate him.
He is ruthless.
And, the man thinks.
Which is more than you or I could do.
Leofric the warrior.
May I sit with you?
No, you may not.
Do the monks know you're missing?
Uhtred, this is Aethelwold, another arseling.
Nephew of the King.
No, I am not the nephew of the King.
I am the King.
But Alfred likes to pretend and every bastard appears to be happy with the lie.
What are we talking about?
Alfred.
Mm. He will not allow me to fight.
Have I told you that?
Many times.
Well, it's true. He will not allow me to fight.
What I ought to do is slit his gizzard.
Say that to anyone but me, boy, and you'll be hanged.
You are hurting royalty.
Agh!
You're lucky Alfred hasn't had you killed.
God will not allow him.
I like God.
Silver?
Yes.
Why?
You're leaving me.
Are you drunk?
Maybe a little.
We'll give the silver to young Ragnar.
Tomorrow, dusk.
He's here.
We can tell him the truth.
And we can join Ragnar and his men.
I need men bound to me by God, by duty, by the land, by Wessex itself.
I would again like to put to Uhtred the prospect of marriage.
To my goddaughter?
To Mildrith, yes.
Well, it would certainly bind him to the land and, indirectly, to the church, to God.
It would test him.
It would.
You would be in favor, still?
Of course.
Anything for Wessex.
Uhtred Ragnarson is a good man to be.
Look at me.
You owe Alfred nothing.
To him, your word means nothing.
You're a pagan.
Please.
Uhtred Ragnarson can never become Uhtred of Bebbanburg.
Never.
Did you kill my father?
You need to ask?
Did you kill my family?
He didn't!
I'm speaking with Uhtred.
I won't ask a second time.
If you believe that I would kill our father, our mother, and our family... take your revenge.
I knew it. 
I had to be sure. I knew it.
 It was Kjartan.
Kjartan attacked and set the fire.
If we could have saved them, we would have.
I knew it.
I didn't believe a word I was hearin'.
We have Ragnar's wealth.
We kept it for you.
 Brida.
Fully grown woman now.
I've seen this moment in my dreams so many times.
So Kjartan's story is that the English rose against our father, encouraged by you.
He claims to have revenged himself for the killers.
Did you ever believe him?
 Never.
But he is Lord Kjartan now.
He has three times the men.
And the ear of Ubba.
Hmm.
When I kill him, it will need to be planned.
When we kill him.
It will be dangerous.
It must be done.
Ragnar, we're with you.
Then you will sail with me?
I will.
I've sworn to Alfred.
It means nothing.
Well, if you have sworn, then you must keep your word.
I need this revenge like I need water.
When the time is right, I swear, I'll be with you.
I know.
 
I can't believe I'm about to let you go, lose you.
 
You've been half my life.
 
All of my madness.
   
Be happy.
       
I take it she has gone, then.
I'm guessing that it's Alfred that kept you here.
I sold myself.
For a mail coat and helmet.
That's what we do, we sell ourselves.
 
This year, what you're giving to Alfred, it's not about a mail coat.
It's about you.
The bastard thinks, didn't I say?
 
He wants more than a year's service.
He wants you to help take back England.
All of England.
Of course, when the year's up, you could go back to the Danes.
That would at least give me the chance to kill ya.
But what would you be?
Who would you be?
 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SEASON: 01
EPISODE: 02
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[Uhtred] I was born an ealdorman of England...
Uhtred, son of Uhtred of Bebbanburg, welcome to the Christian world.
...true heir to the Northumbrian lands of Bebbanburg.
You have your stone, the Amber?
Yes, father.
Lord [Uhtred] Our ancestors took this land, and you will die for it if needed.
I was 12 years old when I first went to war...
[man] kill them all!
...and saw my father killed.
My uncle took my lands and pledged his allegiance to the Danes.
My advice for you is to never cross Ubba and never, never fight him.
Stolen by the invade along with a Saxon girl, Brida, I became first a slave and then a son to Earl Ragnar.
That was my family, my life... young Ragnar, my brother, and Brida, my lover.
Fate had made me a Dane, and then fate brought betrayal.
Aaaaah!
I will not stand by and have everything that's mine taken from me.
Bebbanburg is mine!
Destiny is all.
Horses!
 
Head for the woods.
Go right. There's a gully over that Ridge.
[Aelfric] Hoof marks! There must be hoof marks.
There must be hoof marks somewhere.
Fetch more men. I want him found.
Goes as far as Mercia if need be, but I want him found, and I want him dead.
He looked like my father.
And now he knows you're alive, he'll keep looking for you.
Let him.
I'm going to kill him and take back what's mine.
He has an army. He is the choice of the Danes.
All you have is me.
No.
We have Ubba. We go to him with our story.
And with his army, we avenge Ragnar's death and we take back Bebbanburg.
It's that simple?
Yes.
Yes. 
 
[Uhtred] Brida.
Brida.
Sing me a song.
I won't.
I'm not your skald.
True, and what's more, you'd frighten the birds.
What?
There's a taste in the air.
Death.
Aah!
Who did this? Who sacked the village?
[man] I cannot move.
Your back is broken.
 
Who did it?
You know who did this.
Danes did this.
Why?
I don't believe you.
Why should the Danes attack a village that feeds them?
Revenge.
But since when have Danes needed excuse to kill?
[Brida] Revenge?
Revenge for what?
Huh?
Revenge for what, and I'll end it.
An uprising north of here.
A Saxon slave, he killed his master at a wedding party.
What was the name of the slave?
Huh?
You speak English well for a Dane.
Aah!
His name!
Uhtred.
End it.
End... It.
Say it.
Say what?
What you're thinking.
I'm thinking that you have a turd where there's supposed to be a mind.
Thank you.
We should never have gone to Bebbanburg.
We should have let them believe that you were dead.
No, you're wrong.
I want them to know that I am alive.
I need them to know that I'm alive because they hold what's mine.
I feel better for it.
Yeah? So does a dog pissing on a tree.
You wish me to bark?
What we needed to do was to ride south to the chieftain Ubba and tell the story of Ragnar's death.
We'll do it now.
Now there is a second story about some slave who killed his master.
Ubba knows that Ragnar was my father.
He knows nothing. I doubt he'll even remember you.
He will believe the story that he hears first, and he will kill you.
If you could write, then you could write to him.
If he could read.
You've left us no choice.
We must find Ubba and hope he believes you.
My Lord?
My Lord Alfred, it is I, father Beocca.
My Lord, the King has called council.
[Alfred] Do not look at me, father.
I am a sinner. I am a grievous sinner.
We're all sinners, my Lord.
I am married.
I should never have married.
He sends temptation to test us.
And when we fail, he sends the Danes to punish us for the failure.
I should never have married. I should have joined the church.
I should have gone to a monastery.
And God would have found a great servant in you, but I feel he has other plans.
If your brother were to die, it would be to you the people would turn.
I'll pray God he does not die.
What kind of a King would I be?
You will be God's King, my Lord.
You've been blessed and chosen by the holy father in Rome.
You will be God's King.
I have seen the girl who torments you.
She must be banished.
No, I believe the opposite.
She should be brought into your service.
No. No, I could not.
You... you will resist her.
You will let him see your strength.
You will thank him for tempting you and then praise him for resisting the temptation.
Not withstanding...
I have news you may wish to take to council.
What news?
Of an English uprising, Lord, in the North.
It was defeated.
But the nobleman responsible was Uhtred of Bebbanburg.
I know him.
He was taken by the Danes as a child, a God-fearing child.
Clearly, his heart remains English.
He lives?
I believe so.
He's a warrior, Lord.
They say he killed his Danish master and 40 men.
He knows their ways. He speaks their language.
He would be useful. Would he not?
You could mention him in council.
Why would he kill his master?
For blood, for money, for pleasure?
For England, Lord.
Yes, but how do we know?
He may well be just one more pagan with a busy sword.
Uh, but I know him.
No, father Beocca, you knew him once.
You knew him as a child.
I could send word out into the country, god-willing...
Father Beocca, he's a ghost. He's a pagan rumor.
Should he become flesh and blood, then he may merit a mention.
However, my faith I reserve for God alone.
Now, about this girl... You may be right about her.
Bring her into my personal service and pray for me.
As always, my Lord.
Alfred.
King Edmund of East Anglia writes a plea to Wessex for an army.
An attack by the Danish chieftain Earl Ubba is inevitable. This was 2 days ago.
A long march to fight the Danes at a place of their choosing is not a strategy worth considering.
To say the least, my Lord.
I'm of a mind to decline. Unlikely.
Ubba, he is the Dane whom King Edmund has fed and watered in the past?
Yes.
Perhaps in the hope that he would simply pass through East Anglia on his way to invading Wessex.
It is my opinion that Edmund deserves nothing but silence.
Too harsh, young Odda.
I believe it was Edmund's hope to convert the Danes from pagan to Christian, beginning with charity.
For that, he deserves praise, surely.
True, my Lord, if indeed that was his hope.
Edmund is a godly man.
We have no reason to mistake his actions for cowardice.
[Aethelred] Regardless of Edmund's intentions, barring a miracle, East Anglia will soon fall to the Danes.
And he shall have all our prayers for such a miracle, my Lord.
He will need them.
He will not, however, have one man of Wessex.
On that we are agreed?
Yes, Lord. Aye.
Then we must therefore recognize that we now stand alone, the last kingdom of England.
It will soon be men of Wessex staring across a field at the pagan army.
We must be ready. We must pray.
We must prepare.
Odda, I require that Mercia, Lunden, and East Anglia be watched, carefully.
Forward knowledge is everything.
It is done, my Lord.
And, scribe, I require the forges of every town and village to be burning night and day.
We shall need all the iron those fires can proffer.
Yes, my Lord.
Most of all, I require men, strong fighting men who are prepared to die because that, in the end, is what it will take to save us.
The blood of men.
Ravn used to say, "never fight Ubba."
Looks like East Anglia's just made that mistake.
We should stay away from there, build our own fire.
[Brida] Ubba is unpredictable.
He takes his orders from the gods.
I know.
He only listen to his sorcerer, and he's half-mad.
How will you approach him?
As a man.
Has to be done.
Yes, it has to be done. But we need to guard your life.
How?
I don't know.
We should hump tonight.
We should. It's written.
That we should hump?
Our destiny's to hump tonight.
I'm enjoying the thought of it.
That's all you'll enjoy tonight.
Stop, stop, stop.
What? What is it?
I... I think I have it.
We take a hostage, a shield, a guarantee for your life.
Who?
I don't know.
Someone he can't do without.
Storri, his sorcerer.
[man] Who is this woman?
Why is she not on her back?
Well, not that it's your concern, but she's for Storri...
A Saxon whore from Ubba.
I've seen you before.
I served Earl Ragnar. Now I serve Ubba.
Wo[man] Aah!
[man] Quiet, woman.
You'll see me again, I'm sure, boy.
I'm told Storri's at the church.
He's up at the monastery, looking after King Edmund and killing his priests.
Hello?
[Storri] Leave or it will be the death of you.
This church is mine by the order of Ubba.
Master Storri, I have a gift for you.
Really?
She's from Earl Ubba.
A woman? Why would Ubba send me a woman?
I have no need for a woman.
She's a sorceress.
He wishes her dead but is afraid of a curse.
Saggy tits, stinking breath, but you'll be rewarded.
Her head's white and silver.
A sorceress.
She has the face of a she-wolf.
Does she bite?
Yes, she bites.
Leave her with me.
I will do as Ubba asks, and she will die... Slowly.
Aah!
You belong to me now, old man.
And you will die slowly unless you do as I say.
On your feet.
We're going for a walk, and you will keep your mouth shut.
This is so foolish.
Ubba will come look for me.
And he will be here soon.
I said be quiet.
Then I'll wait for him here.
I'll wait for Ubba here.
That means it's just you and me.
[Ubba] Where's Storri? He's supposed to be here.
Edmund.
Edmund.
Can we have some ale?
Miserable King Edmund of East Anglia.
You have had a night to consider my offer.
How do you answer?
Are you dead or breathing still?
With luck, he's dead.
We allow far too many of them to live as it is.
You allow nothing.
He lives.
It is God who decides who lives.
I would say your God has left you hanging, sir.
If he has done so, it's because it is his will.
Take him down and do not let him fall.
An ale and for your old Guthrum.
Put him there.
And give the man some ale.
Earl Ubba.
If I may speak freely.
I know you.
I'm Uhtred Ragnar's son.
I'm here with the truth of how my father died.
Yes. You are Ragnar's slave, and you killed him.
I don't know what stories you've heard, but Earl Ragnar was killed by his own, by Danes.
His former shipmaster Kjartan, and his half-blind son, Sven.
They led the attack on a sleeping wedding party.
Can't you see that we're entertaining a King?
Lord Ubba, I'm telling you that Earl Ragnar was killed by Danes.
You be quiet, boy!
And you will wait.
kill him.
Not another word.
Bar the doors. He does not leave.
Guthrum is right.
We are entertaining a King, so no more interruptions.
I just have to know who is that.
Hmm?
His eyes are watching me.
And me.
Who's... who's what? Who?
That half-naked image here.
Who is it?
That is Saint Sebastian, a former Roman soldier who found God.
Found him where?
He... he found him in his heart, not...
Do you wish me to tell you the story?
I have time.
The emperor of Rome, on discovering that Sebastian had found God, ordered him to renounce his faith.
He refused.
So then the emperor ordered that he be filled full of arrows, and yet he lived.
He lived?
Yes, he did.
Is this true?
Of course, it's true.
God saved Saint Sebastian, and God should be praised for that mercy.
For how long did he live?
Well, sadly, he...
He then ordered him to be, clubbed to death.
So he died?
He went to heaven, so he lived.
I heard mention of this heaven.
What is this heaven?
Heaven is Valhalla, Lord, to the Christians, but without the fighting, feasting, and humping.
Heaven is... is heaven. It's not heathen.
But to answer your very first question, I... I have considered your offer, and yes, I will continue to rule East Anglia as you suggest.
I will do all that you demand.
But...
Only if you, Lord Ubba, and all of your men, submit to God.
That is my demand.
You must be baptized.
You must stand in a barrel of water, and they pour more water over you.
They want to wash me?
No.
Your scent upsets them, Ubba.
Look, to cleanse you of your sins.
There is only one God, and I demand that you serve him.
kill him now!
Why must I serve him?
Because God is great, all powerful, all magnificent.
Have him stop his yapping, and prove it!
Ah, agreed. Prove to me your God is great.
Prove it.
[Edmund] Proof?
Proof... proof look! Here!
God spared Saint Sebastian.
But the man still died.
Because it was God's will.
So would your God protect you from my arrows?
If he was all powerful, he would.
Yes, if it was God's will, he would, yes.
So let us try.
We shall shoot arrows at you, and if you survive  We will all be washed.
Including Guthrum here.
Why not?
Very well.
I will continue to be King, but we will dispense with the need for the baptisms the washing.
I withdraw my request.
But you claim your God is all powerful.
I want it proven.
Strip him.
Archers.
[Guthrum] Wait.
Tell me truthfully.
Are you afraid?
God is great.
We will see.
shoot.
shoot!
Uh-uh-uh.
They're my men, and only I tell them when to shoot.
shoot. 
Do you now wish to be clubbed, or will the arrows be sufficient?
You come a long way, boy, to tell me that it was Danes and not you that killed Ragnar.
It was Kjartan and Sven, Lord, and others.
It's the truth.
Why else would I be here?
To spy, to lie.
No, Lord.
Perhaps to kill me.
No, Lord.
Have you been washed?
Odin is my God.
But have you been washed?
Yes, Lord.
How did it feel?
The washing.
Cold, Lord. The water was cold.
Nothing else?
I was a child, Lord. Now I'm a Dane.
Yeah, a Dane.
So, now let us see if Odin will protect you from the arrows.
I like this game.
Strip him. Keep away from me.
Not another step!
Archers, at the ready.
I have a hostage.
What?
I have Storri.
Stop!
If I die, he dies.
If I die, your sorcerer dies, and you're without his guidance.
He lies. I can smell it.
I have proof.
His runes.
Storri will be returned to you safely.
Take his head from his shoulders!
Guthrum, be quiet!
Have them open the doors.
I will release Storri when I'm clear of this place.
You go nowhere.
Then he dies!
Your sorcerer dies!
Have them open the doors.
One day, I will kill you.
Storri will tell you otherwise.
And I'm telling you the truth about Ragnar.
Raaah!
Excellent. Firewood.
You're alive.
That's good.
Did he hear you?
He did not, not a word.
Then what did he say?
That he'll kill me.
Nothing else?
Where's Storri?
What did he say?
He's naked.
It was necessary.
There's a branch up his ass.
Which is why he's naked.
Uhtred.
Uhtred, he must have said something.
He believes the lie.
He believes that I killed Ragnar.
There's nothing more to do.
We should put distance between us and this place.
And go where?
Anywhere that's not here.
I say we go to young Ragnar.
He's in Ireland.
Then we go to Ireland.
How?
In what do we sail? In what?
And with whom, Danes?
Then we wait for him to return.
What if he doesn't return? What then?
Accept it. We're lost.
We're alive and breathing for a reason.
Brida... we are no longer Danes.
 
How much for your work?
For a long sword?
Tell me what you need, and I'll tell you a price.
A warrior's sword to last a lifetime.
And what are you?
A Saxon or Dane?
Northumbria.
It will take some time to make her right...
...which means she'll be expensive.
If she's right, I'll pay in silver.
How much?
10 pieces, half now.
 6, no more.
Oh, 8.
And I'll make it my finest.
8. And if she's not your finest, she'll be a first.
I want this stone set into the handle.
That can be done.
Don't sell it nor lose it.
Ale, my Lord?
You stand too close, girl.
Yes, just a little.
To take away the taste of the gruel.
You stand too close.
It is broth, not gruel.
Is it?
You should be thanking God for its goodness and the banishment of those awful cramps.
I am happy to eat as you eat.
Oh, and you are saintly, my dear.
Father Beocca, join us for breakfast.
I dare you.
Alas, my Lord, I've already eaten.
Well, you're fortunate.
Bad news, Lord, your your nephew Aethelwold...
Isn't it always?
...he's drunk.
He's sleeping in the palace gardens.
Should I take him to the King?
It's the second time this week.
May God strike him down painfully.
What? What?
On your feet, boy.
Wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Come on. The King wants to see you.
Drunk?!
What, again?
You think this is fit?!
Out, all of you. Leave us.
Do you think this is fit?
I have been mistreated.
I... you s... you saw this for yourself.
And i-i demand that this this bear is punished.
Aethelwold, your years do not hide the fact that you are a disappointment.
May I ask why?
That you need to ask tells your father all he needs to know.
What?
That you are an unsuitable heir, that is what.
Then I will change.
You should.
I will.
Look, all I ask is that you become a man and quickly.
Today.
Today, I promise.
Am I excused?
My lords.
I'm not convinced he is my son.
If his mother were not already dead, I'd have her beheaded for adultery.
If I am to fall in the battles that will come, he cannot be King.
You favor Alfred?
I do.
Even though he is often weak in body?
Well, that his illness does not tie him to his bed shows the strength of my brother.
Alfred is my heir.
He knows it.
And when the time comes, Odda, my friend, you must steer the witan to make this choice.
My Lord.
Should be safe for now.
They say Danes rarely come here.
What did Storri say to you to make you bind his mouth and, uh...
He threw a curse.
Saying what?
It's not important.
I responded with a branch.
What are you doing?
You know what I'm doing.
I'm removing the last of his curse with a kiss.
I don't want to.
If you want to go to the Danes, then go, find a new Lord.
It's me they wish to kill.
You sound like a child.
I'm offering you a choice.
You're talking through your ass.
I'm sitting on my ass.
So your ass is cleverer than you.
It can do two things at once.
Thank you.
Your tongue is sharp, woman.
Show me again.
No.
You're right.
We can't go to young Ragnar.
But we should wait for him to find us, which he will.
He will want to know the truth.
And the time between, we stay alive.
We pass the time.
Doing what?
Hmm.
Ah! Bleh!
 
 
I've given her some beauty, but she is a tool, no more, no less.
She's exactly as I'd hoped.
We said 10?
We said 8.
She's worth 10.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Lord, men have been asking of you and your woman.
Danes or Saxon?
Take your pick.
Five or more.
Make her sing.
Brida, we should leave. There are men looking for us.
From Ubba?
I don't know.
Saxons and Danes are looking for us.
We seem to be collecting enemies as we go.
Get to the horses. Go, go, go!
Out the way! Out the way! Hey!
Ugh!
Aah!
Brida, the horses are just there.
Wait, there's another. We have to go. Go!
Brida, the door.
[Brida] Wait.
Wait, wait.
Now!
You're right. We should leave.
[Brida] Whoever it was that sent them, Ubba or your uncle, they won't rest.
There'll be others.
I can't go home without help.
Uhtred, you should forget Bebbanburg.
No.
No, I wont vanish.
Nothing changes.
Kjartan and my uncle will pay for Ragnar's death, and I will have those lands.
But how? With whose help?
You said yourself, we only have Ubba.
The English.
If we're dead to the Danes, we have no choice.
 There is no England.
The Danes have England.
No, there is one place, south of here.
It's Wessex.
They'll take one look at you and kill you as a Dane.
Whereas Ubba will kill me as an Englishman.
With King Aethelred, we have a chance of everything.
What do you say?
Come with me.
 
Why do they stare?
They think you're pretty.
Ha.
Or they've never seen a Dane so close.
But they will.
I have business with the King, Aethelred.
[man] Go home!
Do you not understand English?
Is that what you're speaking, actually?
Sound like a Dane.
Why do you dress as a warrior when you're clearly a farmer?
Farmer, am I?
Well, I'd wager this farmer against you any time.
We're here to see the King, peaceably.
Uhtred, what are you doing?
What is it, farmer?
First blood or to the death?
Uhtred!
I'll be splitting your skull, boy.
So one follows the other.
Uhtred?
Father Beocca.
My goodness.
You know this hassling, father?
[Beocca] I do. Yes, I do.
Uhtred, you're... you're fully grown.
And you're old.
I am.
Oh, you're a man.
He claims business with the King.
Yes. Yes, it's true.
But not with the King. It must be with Alfred.
You vouch for him?
I vouch for him.
Yes, I will vouch for him.
God has sent you, surely.
You're a man.
Father, this is Brida, my greatest friend.
A woman?
Yes.
I am.
I have tits.
I see.
Have their horses fed and watered.
And I'll inform Alfred that you're here with me, both.
We need their weapon, father.
Why not inform the King?
The King's busy.
But you will like Alfred.
He's an impressive man.
Come.
You like it?
I do.
It's beautiful.
You could rest here, it's so quiet.
[Alfred] Peaceful.
The, uh, the Romans, they built this courtyard for just that purpose, tranquility.
You're Alfred.
I am.
My Lord.
You are Uhtred.
I hear word you are a considerable warrior.
Not been tested, Lord. Not yet.
And I've been lucky.
Well, luck is good.
Or so my own warriors say.
Now, I haven't quite worked out the theology of luck.
Can there be luck if God disposes?
Well, if your God's with you, you're a lucky man.
Yes.
You're right.
Simply put, but you're right.
With me. We shall talk inside briefly.
Father Beocca has talked much about you, Uhtred.
He believed you a prisoner, a slave to Earl Ragnar.
Is that the case?
Ragnar was a father to me.
I loved him.
Yet in everwich, they are saying that you killed him.
They lie.
Kjartan.
Kjartan, is that how you pronounce it?
Kjartan?
Kjartan.
Has benefited most from Ragnar's death.
He has taken his place and is Earl Kjartan now, a great Lord with ships.
That's written down?
Whatever I discover about my enemies is written down.
It is in Kjartan's interest to kill you, is it not?
He would not want Ragnar's son to hear a different tale.
He would not wish him to hear the truth, no.
No.
And the chieftain Ubba, although he himself has now traveled north, he has sent men to Mercia asking of your whereabouts.
But not your welfare, I surmise.
How do you come by all of this?
I have eyes and ears in each of the kingdoms.
One day, it is my hope that all kingdoms will become one, united under one God.
One King?
If all men can agree, yes.
All that remains of England is Wessex.
The birth of an England, the idea of a single kingdom called England, has to begin here.
There is nowhere else.
But for how long will Wessex remain?
The fate of Wessex will be determined by Englishmen, all Englishmen.
Only by joining together and saving Wessex can we have England.
Only by saving Wessex can we have a...
A Northumbria, a Bebbanburg.
And if Wessex can't be saved?
Then we are all no more.
Prayers.
And a little discomfort.
I will summarize.
The Danes are gathering a great army.
They have, in fact, gathered an army.
They gather where?
They have moved upriver from Lunden to Readingum.
They are settling as we speak.
But you said Ubba's in the north, so who leads them?
The Earl Guthrum leads them.
I know Guthrum.
We will need every advantage, and father Beocca considers you, Uhtred of Bebbanburg, to be an advantage.
Whereas I believe you're here solely to hide, to save yourself.
I look at you, and I see a Dane.
I see Uhtred of nowhere who cares for no one but himself.
Now I must go to prayers. You will join me?
My Lord will excuse me.
[Brida] Us both.
Of course.
I expected as much.
Father Beocca.
[Beocca] My Lord?
Take your guests for refreshments.
I will, my Lord.
They may remain in Winchester, but I hold you responsible.
Yes, Lord.
You should have gone along and prayed with him.
It would have bonded you.
He believes we're pagans.
What Alfred believes is that the Danes have abandoned you.
Ubba has abandoned us. There are other lords.
Most, if not all, follow Ubba, so believe me, girl, you have been abandoned.
Yeah, you know everything about the Danes, don't you?
This way. I want to show you something.
The charters of Bebbanburg?
Yeah.
The land books.
Yeah.
You kept them safe?
Now, I've shown them to Alfred, he... he knows you are the ealdorman, by right.
I will continue to keep them safe, but, Uhtred, you must behave like an ealdorman.
The charters have no meaning.
Northumbria belongs to the Danes.
It does not belong to the Danes. It has been stolen by them.
If you want wealth, you take it.
You can't ignore what's true.
If the Danes are at Readingum, I'll go to Readingum.
What?
For what purpose?
Knowledge.
But we have knowledge, and you should stay away from the Danes.
For new knowledge.
You know where they're settling, but you don't know why.
[Beocca] We know their number and their position.
But not their intention.
Am I a prisoner?
Their intention is to attack.
When?
Spring.
It's always spring.
I'll go to Readingum.
Where is it?
It's too dangerous.
Not for me. I'm a godless Dane, remember?
So why spy for Alfred?
Because he is an ealdorman of England.
[Beocca] Lord?
Regarding the conversion of the pagans to Christianity...
Yes, Lord.
How do we decide what is proper?
To enlighten them or to kill them?
Spreading God's word is, of course, our mission, but I fear that the pagans, the true pagans, must first witness and feel his power.
Uhtred, will return?
Yes, he will return.
Yes, but how will he return, as who, as what?
I know this boy.
Ah, but this boy is now a man.
I know his soul.
Father Beocca, he has no soul.
And you say yourself, the pagans need to feel the power of God.
It is written now here.
You may leave me.
We shall see what the days bring, my Lord.
If resting through the winter was their intention, they would have remained in Lunden, yes?
It's you who's Alfred's spy.
The next step is to kill for him.
Will you do that?
Answer me this.
If we were to cross this river and find Guthrum, what would happen?
He'd kill us both.
We owe them nothing.
Alfred needs to know about the Danes, and I need to win his trust.
You think he'll deliver you Bebbanburg.
What if you're wrong?
Alfred...
You have called council. For what reason?
Lord, forgive me, it may well be for no good reason.
But we have a pagan in court who claims to have knowledge regarding the Dane army.
Pagan?
Forgive me, Lord, he's Uhtred of Bebbanburg.
I vouch for his word.
Uhtred!
Lord.
I've been to Readingum.
I watched the Danes.
Their intention is not to settle.
If it were, they would've remained in Lunden.
You are saying what, that they intend to attack?
I am, Lord.
We already know this.
Come spring, they'll be at our door.
They'll be marching within days, Lord. I'm sure of it.
How can you possibly be sure of it?
_.
They made their sacrifices. The ordinary warriors, they caught and killed birds, jackdaws.
This is only done in the days before battle.
And they're hungry.
Then perhaps they've eaten these jackdaws.
They've many hundreds of men and horses and few supplies.
They'll first seize a town rich with grain and livestock.
I don't know the country well, but I've traveled.
I believe Abbendum is such a place.
To defeat the Danes, you must meet them on the road to Abbendum.
They'll be within days, Lord.
[Alfred] You went to Readingum alone? With Brida.
Why alone?
Why not?
Well, because for most of your life, you have lived as a Dane. You look like a Dane.
You can speak the language of a Dane.
Therefore, I surmise you can set a trap like a Dane.
Agreed, my Lord. He imagines we are jackdaws.
[Aethelred] Where on the road to Abbendum?
Where would you choose to meet their army?
I would choose the place called Asec's Hill, Lord.
You would choose or Guthrum would choose?
I've seen it. The pass narrows.
You cannot be outflanked.
For the Danes to fight uphill, it will be difficult, but they'll be confident.
They don't fear west Saxons.
Why? Why do they not fear us?
They believe you to be farmers, nothing more.
So even with the sun in their eyes, which is possible, they will climb the hill to fight, and that can be to our advantage.
[Odda] "To our advantage," he says.
You've been here for a matter of days, and already you claim to be of Wessex.
This is nonsense.
This is all far too convenient, my Lord.
My Lord, my sword was made by a Saxon Smith.
My sword is for Wessex.
Do not interrupt a noble when he is speaking.
[Aethelred] Odda.
I believe this man and this bag of rags that follows him to be imposters. Odda.
No army marches as winter approaches.
Young Odda, enough from you now!
My Lord.
You.
You've spoken, given this council much to discuss.
My Lord.
Alfred, he's here at your invitation.
What now?
Should the Danes march, we must face them.
And I would rather be at the top of a hill than on the flat.
I say we march to Asec's Hill.
But...
Take him.
Take them both. Make them secure.
My Lord?
What is this?
I've spoken the truth.
I've spoken the truth!
Father Beocca!
[Beocca] My Lord, please.
Beocca, help me!
Beocca!
Have faith!
 
 ...Dissipa illorum machinations et astutias, ut nos tuis armis munity semper servemur ab omnibus periculis, ad glorificandum Te, qui es unicus Victoria largitor...
[Aethelred] Hold! Hold!
...propter merita unigeniti...
Filii tui domini nostri jesu Christi. Amen.
[Aethelred] Left flank, hold!
Hold!
Archers, ready!
On my command!
For God!
For Wessex!
For England!

SEASON: 01
EPISODE: 01
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lord [Uhtred] Boy!
The tide is on the turn.
I'll not warn you again!
[Osbert] Ships! There!
Danes.
The devil's turds.
Are they traders?
No. They come as vikings!
We go!
Go, go!
 
 
Lord [Uhtred] Where is my son?
Uhtred.
Take half a dozen men ride to the river.
There are pagans there.
You watch them, see how many there are.
Of course, father.
Do nothing more. You understand?
Yes, father.
Osbert, what is it?
Ships. I saw them first from the beach.
What ships?
Danes.
They're heading for the river.
God and the saints preserve us.
They have no soul.
We must pray. We must act.
Uhtred, do not fight them.
Not a single one.
Be back by nightfall.
Yes, father.
They are sent by god to punish us for our sins.
Our sins be damned.
They're here to support the viking army at Eoferwic.
Aelfric! We must instruct the priest to pray for our deliverance!
Aelfric!
Lord?
Get them inside.
We take in as many women and elders as we can.
The rest to higher ground and out of sight.
Send word to rouse the country.
I want every man inside this fortress.
And every man must be prepared to die.
 
Father.
[man] Rest your oars. Rest your oars.
Taste.
Land.
Fresh... Sweet water.
Yes.
What else do you see?
I see a clear river, fish as big as a man's leg.
I see a forest alive with meat.
But more than that, I see a place to grow fat and old.
Horses.
Yeah. And I see spies sh1tting themselves.
 Yeah!
We'll meet sword with sword!
You are pagans... we have a greater god on our side!
Kjartan, I think we should teach this boy a lesson.
[Kjartan] Taking her in.
At speed!
[man] Pick up the speed!
Lord [Uhtred] Why do I leave the villages unprotected and bring the men inside?
Is that your question?
A village can be rebuilt. A warrior can die only once.
The Danes may be heading south to Eoferwic.
But they will kill whoever they can on the way.
Now, go and find the priest.
Yes, father.
[Beocca] Come in, Osbert. Don't skulk in the shadows.
He, uh, wants to know if you're ready.
Almost.
Do you know what I'm tasked with?
A letter?
A response to a letter. This letter from king Aella.
Asking your father for his support, his army, to help recapture the city of Eoferwic.
This is why it's important for you to be able to read and write.
Father can't read and write.
Well, for your father, it's too late.
King Aella could have sent a man on horseback.
But who is to say that the man on horseback speaks the truth?
Or has remembered the true message?
What these letters will represent is history, facts.
Your father is informing king Aella and king Osbert he will be alongside their armies at Eoferwic.
And the mark of Bebbanburg will guarantee the truth of it.
Why do we fight for Eoferwic?
Well, we fight for Eoferwic because we do not wish to see England, piece by piece, become Daneland.
I heard it said that we were pagans once.
That wooden and Odin are the same.
We saw the error of our ways, and we look to Rome.
I heard the pagans had fierce gods of war.
Well, we are right and they are mistaken.
Osbert, we are blessed.
I should make you swear on St. Cuthbert's comb never to mention the likes of wooden again.
But what if I had a hound called wooden?
What if I did? What would you do then?
Well, you haven't.
You have not. What if you had a pig called Thor?
Come, let's go see your father. Come.
 A pig called Thor.
[man] Horsemen approaching!
 
He rides Uhtred's horse.
Osbert.
No!
No!
Bury what's left of him.
Osbert, come on.
Remind me of the last words I spoke to him.
You told him to watch, do not fight.
We have no idea of the circumstance...
"do not fight" means do not fight.
He was young.
There was no fight to be had until Eoferwic.
[Beocca] You wanted to see Osbert, my lord.
You.
You are now called Uhtred. Uhtred, son of uhtred.
You have your stone, the Amber?
Yes, father.
The priest will show you your history and parchments.
Make him understand who he is.
[Beocca] Lord, I should like to baptize him again.
Well, if he arrives at heaven's gate as Uhtred, they might wonder what's happened to Osbert.
Do what you must. Do as I ask.
Lord.
We were kings here once, boy.
Kings of all the lands between the rivers Tuede and tine.
We should be kings again. Yes, we should.
But it does not matter what they call us, so long as they obey.
Our ancestors took this land, and it has been strengthened with our blood and bone.
Now you are the new heir of Bebbanburg.
You hear me?
And you will die for it if needed.
Yes, father.
And I will give you the head of the man who killed Uhtred.
No, you are Uhtred!
Have you not been listening to me?!
Do not tell me what it is you will do... you are just a pup!
You will give me nothing!
You will watch, and you will learn!
Put him in the water before his mother's tongue gives me grief.
She's not my mother.
Will you take him with you to battle to watch and learn?
He's old enough.
I need you to choose 30 men to remain here at Bebbanburg.
Protect the boy. He is the heir.
30 will hold and is few enough to feed.
Will you do this for me?
I'd rather be with you at Eoferwic, but I'll do as you ask.
Thank you.
 [Beocca] Hurry, please.
Heavenly father, receive your servant Uhtred into the holy kind of saints and into the ranks of the most bright angels.
Let your holy waters cleanse him and make him worthy of your blessing.
Make him your instrument and your rod.
Let him realize the significance of the written word so that he may learn of your glory, and in turn, may spread your word.
Beo... let him grow in wisdom and in respect so he may lead in a godly manner...
Beocca, he's cleanse.
Amen.
Uhtred, son of Uhtred of Bebbanburg...  welcome to the Christian world.
Behold, your people and your land.
 
Where are the people and the soldiers?
On the road to Eoferwic, led by your father, where they'll join the other two kings of Northumbria.
With... without me?
You are to remain at Bebbanburg with your kindly uncle, who's sworn to keep you safe.
Should you wish to fight, we can always arm-wrestle.
Where's the priest?
With your father. Eat.
You have work to do, Uhtred.
In the stab, thankfully, we've been left some horses.
You should eat.
I'm not hungry.
We have work to do.
Horse shit to shovel.
Come and find me when you've finished.
 
Scallion, if my brother falls in battle...
The boy must fall.
Earl [Ragnar] All this way and no reception party?
Earl Ragnar.
Guthrum.
How are you?
I'm fine. I'm hungry.
And your boy?
He's coming.
Ragnar. Ubba, I brought men and horses.
Good to see you. You're well?
You made a gift of his own son's head.
How did this lord react?
He did nothing.
He brought his warriors into the fortress, kept them inside.
He's saving his men.
That man is Uhtred, one of the three kings of Northumbria... a warrior king.
The other two are fools.
They'd rather be fighting each other.
Is this true?
King Aella and king Osbert... they, both lay claim to Eoferwic.
They have the strangest of names.
So, when do we fight?
Soon, I hope.
I'm still to decide.
Fools or not, they have three armies.
They have numbers. But are divided.
Three kings, but only one who can lead them.
This Uhtred.
Then we kill him, and Northumbria is ours.
All of it.
Listen to him. Listen to the boy.
He reminds me of me.
Yeah, when you were younger.
Of course when I was younger.
He's just a boy.
Uh, just saying.
Earl [Ragnar] Ubba.
Did you say I was old?
Storri?
No.
I'm not getting old.
Ubba.
I have seen the land outside the city.
I have a plan in mind. A good plan.
And my son would like to whet his sword with you.
So do we fight?
Storri?
The signs are good.
Only this morning, I saw a raven fly towards the Saxon camp, and it was asking me to follow.
I'm sure of it.
Hmm.
Then we fight.
 
King [Osbert] What kind of hell is this?
It's a pagan's hell.
We outnumber them.
But there are more.
There must be.
Nothing changes. We attack with half our number.
The second half to follow, once we have the measure of them.
They have conceded to higher ground.
King Aella, yours and lord Uhtred's armies will attack in the first wave.
Prepare!
Prepare!
Shield!
No!
No, not without me!
 
Come nightfall, we'll be rid of this plague, and counting our share of the plunder!
My shield.
 
kill them all!
The wall is holding.
Down! Hands below your shield and drive!
Drive!
Ease.
Ease!
Ease!
Ease!
Push! Keep pushing!
It's working!
Drive them!
[Beocca] They're tiring. They can't fight back.
We're winning look!
Fight!
Come on!
Not yet!
Not yet!
 
Dear god, no.
Shield! Wall!
Dear god of infinite mercy, not this.
kill them all!
Lord [Uhtred] Legs! Legs!
Protect your legs!
Lift up your sword and spare these men of England who fight in your name.
Let the heathens' hearts crumble and wither.
Bestow your power upon these men of England so they can glorify your name with the blood of the devils.
Have mercy now, lord.
Do not forsake us.
Do not forsake England.
Follow me!
Follow me!
Take him!
Close the shield wall!
Close the wall and take him!
No!
He's like a wasp.
Aah!
The wasp has lost its sting.
Yeah.
Oh!
Are you sure he's a Saxon?
He fights like a Dane.
Yeah.
 Wo[man] No!
Earl [Ragnar] Leave her.
She is to live.
Some of these young ones can come in useful.
Father, here is the boy I spoke of.
The one who almost killed you.
You're leaving him with me?
I've never seen a man get the better of you yet.
[Ravn] Cut me some chicken.
Careful. The blade of sharp.
It can kill a man.
The chicken is on your platter.
Oh.
Mm.
Have you always been blind?
Oh, I see enough.
So, who have they been killing below?
Prisoners.
Just now, a king.
Did he die well?
No.
Well, then he shouldn't have been king.
Tell me, who sits in the middle of the hall?
Is it the big man and the small man?
Yes.
And a gray man sits in between them.
If you get to live, you should be aware of the big man... ubba.
My advice for you is to never cross ubba, and never, never fight him.
If I get to live?
He listens to no one but the gods.
Men who take their orders from the gods are...
Unpredictable.
What did you mean when you said "if I get to live"?
You're my prisoner.
The gray man will be Egbert.
He's a Saxon ealdorman.
He has pledged allegiance and now calls himself king.
He is king of nothing.
Soon, all of the kings in England shall be kings of nothing.
Northumbria is ours. Mercia will soon be ours.
Then east Anglia, Cornwallum, and then the greatest prize is the last kingdom... Wessex.
I've heard of Wessex.
Anything will grow in Wessex.
Tell me your name.
Uhtred. I'm the ealdorman of Bebbanburg.
You are, eh?
I am.
I own lands to the north.
How long have you been an ealdorman of these lands?
Your father chose to fight us and is now dead.
He... he was not... Fond of me.
I now understand why my son spared you, Uhtred of Bebbanburg.
You are a warrior.
Have some ale.
Drink it.
Lots of it.
Here. Take it up there.
I'm thinking of keeping them both.
The boy and the girl. They can help your mother.
Disagree?
No.
But you did kill his father.
And if he's an ealdorman, we can sell him for ransom.
Perhaps.
 
Brida, be careful not to spill the water.
You'll turn the floor to mud.
Uhtred, wood needs to be chopped.
Brida, you can do the goats.
[Thyra] Will there be time for Uhtred to play?
Only when work is done.
I don't like our daughter having to play with the slaves.
They're only children.
They have a place.
 Grumpy.
What does the play involve?
We built a hall in the gorge.
I am the mistress and Uhtred is a warrior.
Not a servant?
 It is a game.
[Brida] A wolf!
Uhtred.
[Uhtred] That's it, a wolf.
Boar! Watch out!
I saw it... it had sharp teeth and yellow eyes.
Don't let the wolves get me, Uhtred!
Use the fire to keep them away.
I see them.
They're as big as ubba and smell worse.
 
Did you see that?
Uhtred.
Stay up there.
 Look.
Uhtred, what is happening?
Stay up there, thyra. It's Sven.
He won't hurt you.
But he'll kill us.
He'll kill us!
Run!
 
That was a real sword.
I saw it.
Uhtred!
Thyra!
Uhtred!
What's this?
You been fighting again?
Yes.
With Sven?
Kjartan's son?
Yes.
Uhtred, he's much bigger than you.
He's a turd.
Why do you say that?
[Ravn] Who started it?
Who began the fight?
I began the fight.
For no other reason than that he's a turd?
Danes have murder for less.
Uhtred, that's enough.
You want to be sold, boy?
I wish to eat.
Speak up.
I wish to eat.
You want to eat?
You want to eat?
You know what? I say you starve.
Fighting is expected.
Disobedience is not.
Sven began the fight!
Earl [Ragnar] Kjartan!
Kjartan!
Earl Ragnar, let me first say he's... he's a good boy.
He brought a sword onto my land.
I will have words with him.
In time, he'll serve on your ship.
He... he...
He has offended me.
He will honor you, and he meant no harm, lord.
He meant no harm?
He looked at my daughter's nakedness.
And he was punished. Your Saxon slave cut him.
Shall I make a square of branches?
Are you gonna fight me for your son or fetch him?!
Sven.
Come out here.
Tell him what you have to say.
I'm sorry.
Can't hear you.
I'm sorry, lord, for what I did.
You laid hands on my daughter.
You stripped her naked.
Half-naked, lord. He's at an age, lord.
Is this true?
Half-naked?
Yes, lord.
Then I shall only take his one eye.
[Kjartan] No, lord, please!
Kjartan, you are banished from my land.
 
I have something for you.
What is it?
An amulet. Thor's hammer.
Ah, but...
But what?
You're Christian.
Take it.
Take it. I'm trying.
Take it. 
I don't think he wants it.
I do want it.
 No. I don't think so.
Thank you.
Tell me about Denmark.
What can I say about Denmark?
It's wet.
And harsh.
The ground is so flat and Sandy, you can't grow a fart.
 Which is why we're here in England.
To grow.
And why young Ragnar will soon be going for Ireland.
You leave to fight?
To make my wealth.
If you want land or silver, you have to take it.
You made me... Proud today, Uhtred.
You made me proud.
[Aelfric] I don't know you.
You don't have the appearance of a messenger.
And Ubba's payment's not yet due.
[Kjartan] No, lord.
I was a ship's master.
Ah, well. I have no ships.
I need no ship's master.
I have news that you will want to hear.
Perhaps.
Two days south of here...
Is a rat with the man I used to serve.
Until he banished me.
He has a slave.
He treats him well.
This is a slave you're entitled to buy back, if you wish to.
Buy back?
He's your nephew.
Uhtred, lord.
He lives.
[Uhtred] What if I'm against being ransomed?
Your family has discovered that you're still alive.
And they wish for you to be returned.
But they must pay.
Pay Ragnar?
Ubba takes more than half.
It's normal.
But I have no family.
[man] Keep him over there. Tether the horses.
Scallion. Here.
Uhtred.
They're treating you well?
I am fed, yes.
Good, good. That's all we ask.
What is that around your neck?
Some symbol?
Oh, this?
They... they make me wear it.
May I see it?
Look, I will speak plainly, your uncle will kill you.
Right, you cannot go back to Bebbanburg.
You must escape.
He wants to be the ealdorman.
He wants to be the king, in fact, like the pathetic Egbert over there.
A puppet king for his Danish masters.
You should go to Wessex.
King Aethelred real king Aethelred... and his brother, the prince Alfred... they're good men, good Christian men.
Earl [Ragnar] That's enough whispering in his ear, priest.
Uhtred.
One more word, I'll have your ball bag for a purse.
I'll meet you there.
That will not be necessary.
What did he say?
He... he asked if you were treating me well.
[Aelfric] How much?
[Ravn] 300.
That is a ridiculous amount.
How can a boy be worth 300 pieces of silver?
Because I say so.
Because he is a lord and an ealdorman.
No, he is a boy.
I am the ealdorman of Bebbanburg.
I carry the seal and the banner.
That seal is my father's, which is now mine!
[Ubba] You be silent.
You are for sale, nothing more.
For ransom, lord.
That's what I said.
My lords, I have given up land, horses.
I've offered a generous supply of food as well as my sword.
All I ask in return is a fair price for my only nephew.
What would you say is a fair price?
I will offer 100 pieces of silver.
200.
My allegiance and 100 pieces is surely a fair price.
It is not.
I will give 120 pieces of silver for the boy.
 Not enough.
Very well.
200 pieces.
I agree to your terms.
The boy is sold to Earl Ragnar.
What?
Ransomed, lord.
That's what I said. The matter is closed.
My lords, I have come a long way.
I have offered my allegiance.
Which is why you're allowed to breathe.
If you have an argument, it's with me now.
If business is done, we have ale to drink.
And king Egbert needs to shit!
 
[Uhtred] You bought me for how much?
Too much.
How much is too much?
My sword's weight in silver.
I agree I may have been robbed, but we like you, boy.
We're going to keep you.
Does this mean I'm a Dane?
It means you're Uhtred Ragnar son.
You're a son to me now.
 
Brida, not that way. Take the goat outside.
Next time, I promise.
Mother, look.
It's beautiful. It really is.
I can't believe I'm losing you already.
I will be living across the field.
And if he doesn't treat you well, you just come marching right back across that field.
Whoa, look at this place.
[Thyra] Uhtred.
Do you like my wedding necklace?
I do. Very pretty.
He doesn't know anything about necklaces.
You might as well ask me.
Uhtred, with me.
You can help me slaughter the goats.
I've only just washed.
 The goats will be pleased.
Later, you can sweep the floor.
Move over. 
This is an excuse to talk, that's all.
With thyra to be married, maybe it's time you got together with brida.
There are men... good men... asking about her.
So you have to decide what you are to her.
What you are to each other. 
Brida has her own mind. She has.
But I see the way she looks at you.
She's watching the charcoal tonight in the woods.
Take my horse and join her.
The earth will be warm.
Why not?
I just thought in order to be a real Dane, I had to marry a Dane.
Come on.
I love you like I love young Ragnar.
What are you doing here?
Do you ever think of your English life?
Who you were before we came to Ragnar?
No.
Do you?
I think of who I my... shh!
Voices.
Men below.
Danes. Who are they?
[man] This way.
That's kjartan.
And that man...
That must be Sven.
This is wrong. We need to tell Ragnar.
They're between us and the hall.
Then we go up and around. We leave the horses and run.
In front of the door.
That's it.
 
[Ravn] Ragnar! Smoke!
fire!
Thyra, wake up! Wake up!
Come on! Come on!
This way! Ravn!
Come! Come, quickly!
Come!
The door is blocked!
So is this one!
Be ready.
This one's open! This one's open!
Come on! Follow me!
[man] This way!
[Kjartan] Take the children!
Take them all!
[Ragnar] Archers!
Don't go up there! Wait for me!
[Sigrid] Come, come.
Ragnar.
Close the doors.
We have thyra. Let the rest burn.
 
Take her with you to Valhalla.
Yes.
I'll meet you there.
Find the silver.
Now!
They're searching for Ragnar's wealth.
They'll never find it.
Search in the back.
Come on! We're leaving soon!
[Sven] You thought I'd let you marry someone else?
But do you know what I will do with this body?
This mouth?
I will do all I dreamt of and more.
And who will call a halt?
Earl Ragnar the fearless is gone.
And with him, Uhtred... his Saxon pet... a pile of ashes.
Anything.
Get down!
[Uhtred] Look at that man... the Saxon.
His name's scallion. He works for my uncle.
He'll tell him that I'm dead.
Let him do it.
I see him with kjartan.
[Kjartan] Burn it to the ground.
He and your uncle... maybe they're in it together.
And what makes them believe that they can do this without punishment?
Shh! Shh!
They will be punished, but not by you.
Uhtred, listen to me. We serve Ragnar best alive.
We tell the story.
I need to kill someone.
No.
And I choose him.
Uhtred, no.
Come on!
 The barn's over there!
 Check in his pockets.
The main thing is to keep the horses together.
Don't leave any weapon behind.
Leave those open, and we'll look in the back.
 
[man] Over here!
Right, come on.
You know who I am?
Hmm?
It's me you're looking for.
It's me you're looking for.
You remember me? You remember me?
There's no more.
We're going. Come on.
Bring the horses.
By right, it belongs to young Ragnar.
Yes. But we spend what we need to spend.
We stay alive.
We tell the story, and then what?
We find a new lord to serve.
I will not stand by and have everything that's mine taken from me.
I'm going back.
Where?
To the beginning.
 
Is it scallion?
[man] No, my lord.
He looks like a Dane.
Could be one of Kjartan's men.
 
I am Uhtred of Bebbanburg, and I shall take what is mine.
Bebbanburg is mine!
Horses!
